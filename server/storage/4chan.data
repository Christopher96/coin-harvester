We have no impact on the price at this point whether up or down, it is so far gone into manipulation, it is a whole new world of insanity the market has never seen before. They are controlling the vast majority of the inflow, so there will be no retail FOMO. If it jumps up to a higher number, that is them releasing buy orders into the market at a rate they want, to try and shake people out. So in summary: Price action down = manipulation. Price action up = manipulation. We will not impact ANYTHING in terms of the price you see imo, from here on in. All that can be done is hold, buy dips if that is what you want to do (which will increase their problems), and wait until they have gone through all their shake outs and it arrrives at a number you are happy with. Or you sell along the way, up to you.

Possible the SEC is involved to determine the actual number of votesd. Not every retail trader was able to vote and the amount of shares owned by retail has increased since April 15the. Retail owns the float. Sherman has acknowledged the support by the shareholders and their involvement in the growth of the company. On June 9th (earnings), all ETFs have been tanked to reduce the price of GameStop.b. This is done by shorting the ETF and going long on all other companies in that ETF.Most importantly.

Disgusting.,Here you go sir,daily charles is a charlatan threadPrevious thread: Welcome to the Monero General, dedicated to the discussion of the worlds leading decentralized P2P privacy cryptocurrency!Monero is secure, low-fee, and fungible, meaning users can send XMR around the globe despite corrupt governments or broken financial systems. Innovative privacy features such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and Ring CT ensure that Moneros blockchain is obfuscated -- In other words, the financial history of all Monero users is encrypted from the prying eyes of adversaries on a public blockchain, with transactions being visible only by a user willingly providing a view key.Monero has also improved upon the scaling downsides of current popular cryptos. To avoid high fees, dynamic block size ensures that the size of the blocks will increase as the amount of transactions increases. Further, the mining network algorithm RandomX establishes that anybody with a CPU can participate in mining, preventing the ASIC miner domination that creates a high barrier of entry. Lastly, the mining network will be preserved by Tail Emission -- instead of the block reward falling to zero like with Bitcoin, the block reward will gradually approach 0.6 XMR in June 2022, where it will forever stay. This constant linear inflation means the inflation rate will asymptotically go to zero while continuing to provide an incentive to miners to maintain the network.If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.XMR Redpill: https://youtu.be/wq6w03E2DS4XMR Stats: moneroj.netUSE Monero: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/OFFICIAL WEBSITE - getmonero.orgWHERE TO GET MONERO?KYC:KrakenBinanceBitfinexNon KYC:LocalMoneroMorphtokenBisqKucoinTradeogreCrypto ATMssee: kycnot.meMiningarchive.is/TWOahHOW TO STORE MONERO?DesktopOfficial Gui/CliMy MoneroExodusFeatherMobileIOS: CakewalletAndroid: Monerujo,first,Help widen the gates to financial independence by mining Monero.

Every feature, explained.,Why Monero is so untraceable.- nobody inspecting the blockchain can deterministically prove who signed the transaction. (Ring Signatures)- nobody inspecting the blockchain can determine the amount of XMR being transacted. (Confidential Transactions)- nobody inspecting the blockchain can determine where the XMR was sent to. (Stealth Addresses)- Dandelion++/I2P/Tor provide network-level shielding of IP addresses.TL;DR: Monero addresses   amounts do not appear on the blockchain and thus cannot be derived through chain analysis.In future, Monero will integrate more complex zero-knowledge proof tech (zk-SNARKs/STARKs) once the trade-offs involved become less prohibitive.

It was NOT exploited and subsequent audits have given the all-clear.https://www.getmonero.org/2017/05/17/disclosure-of-a-major-bug-in-cryptonote-based-currencies.htmlAlso worth noting is that prior to the introduction of CT in 2017 XMR amounts were not shielded, meaning an active inflation bug wouldve immediately been noticed.

You can use HWinfo64 to check your watts. How many threads is it using? Do you know your thread hash rate? I am getting about 700 h/s per thread. I am using xmrig. If you have xmrig are you using huge pages? You can also use --cpu-no-yield and --cpu-priority p4 and get a boost.,,Im undervolting, obviously. Using all 24 threads on XMRig, with huge pages, I never tried --cpu-no-yield and --cpu-priority p4 but its a computer I dont use anyway, so the hashrate isnt influenced by other processes I guess.Ill try later to see if I see a difference.,--cpu-no-yield and --cpu-priorityWait since youre here, where do you input the commands? Directly in the config file?,I use command line but you should be able to put it in the config too, but I dont know the exact syntax.no-yield roughly means the threads wont get interrupted by the thread scheduler and this will save cycles.Priority will make the os prioritize resources, it can help even if youre not using it. You could try level p5 if you dont use it for anything else for slightly more performance then p4.,What RAM / settings are you using?

Ive been using mostly cheap cl16 RAM and just using the basic XMP profile in the BIOS but I wanted to try out cl14 RAM to see if it made much of a difference. Im getting about 2KH/s more per 3900x with the CL14 RAM vs the CL16 stuff on the same motherboard model but I guess Im just being too aggressive with the PBO limits. Temps are 60C in a 35C ambient room so I probably could bump everything up by a bit and see.,Non-KYCLocalMonerohave to make an accountlmao,Bitcoin can go much lower than 15k.

Surely your KYC exchange would have some ledger and history of you sending coins to Kucoins wallet, but this must be more obscure than entering you bank details directly into Kucoin.,Typical American behavior. The English should have just killed them all, maybe even take them in as a slave race to be used as literal punching bags.

Seems easy enough to win.,Im sure its 100% mandatory at all KYC exchanges to record where they sent funds, they probably even store it on the blockchain. In all seriousness though, once you pass funds through a KYC exchange I would consider that amount of funds to be tainted. The IRS, if they really wanted to go after you, would have a pretty easy time convincing normies that because you sent $1M from your bank to Kucoin and then on Kucoin bought $1M in a well-known money-laundering/terrorist financing coin called Monero and sent it to some unknown wallet, that you should still be taxed as if you have that $1M sitting in your bank. Their whole world revolves around catching you at on and off-ramps connected to the banking system. They dont need to know what goes on in-between to catch you for tax evasion.,I havent followed everything, but why dont you acquire XMR on a KYC exchange, withdraw to a wallet you wont use again, send those XMR on your non-KYC exchange and play with it there?Sure, the government can know that XMR has been sent to a wallet, but thats all they know. They cant follow the trail from there.,ransomwares and the cyber-pandemic.you have been warned.,Did you guys just get bored of putting Soros on all these memes or something?,Patch me through to the Bogdannoffs, we have a live one.,No.,Shut fuck up Klaus,There may be some tax fuckery involved since the burden of proof is at a much lower bar. If you buy x XMR in 2020 and suddenly ten years later have a new house, sizable investments in clear markets, etc., it might be easier for them to pin it on you if they know for sure you bought XMR at one point through a KYC exchange. That said, the IRS is probably gonna come knocking regardless so Im not sure how much itll affect anything. For whatever its worth, I bought on a KYC exchange for fiat and shuffled it all into cold storage.,If you buy x XMR in 2020 and suddenly ten years later have a new house, sizable investments in clear markets, etc., it might be easier for them to pin it on you if they know for sure you bought XMR at one point through a KYC exchangeNot how that works, they ask you to justify where the money came from. Then the burden is on you.If you want to buy your house with XMR or switch to clear markets, youd have to cash out first, so you either do money laundering schemes or you pay taxes on the gains. Thats the choking point. Not later.In any cases only taxable events are of interest to the IRS, they dont care if you have XMR, they just want you to give them money if you make visible taxable events and they make sure you dont launder money.,they dont care if you have XMRNot officially, but theyre definitely advising lawmakers to ban the sale of XMR.,Youre right anonIts moreso that the gov does know I have the funds over tax evasion. Having a secret stash of coins gives me a semi,If you want to buy your house with XMR or switch to clear markets, youd have to cash out firstAnd theres probably no way around this ever, is there? Property is already highly regulated and obviously visible to the government. Thats if you care about the title though, like the actual on-paper ownership. Ive got this fanciful idea of a world where nobody actually cares anymore what the government has on record with respect to property ownership. It could theoretically be handled entirely via somehow-binding cryptocontracts. This would force the governments hand and either require people to physically reside in set locations, which would unconditionally require a constitutional amendment, or just accept their loss of power.,People literally said this about Bitcoin in 2011 lol,As an ex Monero skeptic (now a Monero maxi), I wanna thank all the anons who patiently and politely replied to me every time and showed me the light of Moneros technical superiority, and even accompanied the replies with cute Monero-chans. This particular picrel I find soothing and thought-provoking.,And theres probably no way around this ever, is there?No, because transaction of big stuff like land, houses, cars, etc, must be informed to the state. So if they ask, you must show where the money came from.,Not officially, but theyre definitely advising lawmakers to ban the sale of XMR.Who cares, if that happens well use Atomic Swaps.Daylighter general threadWhat is daylighting?Daylighting is the practice of working 2 or more full time jobs simultaneously during the same working hours.

He paid out of pocket for the best treatment. Same for my mom when she had cancer. His gold and silver dwindled to around $20k, investments around $5k when it was all said and done. He eventually passed from cancer himself, spent all of his money on his family and said he wouldnt change a thing.

You see Michlan, some people visiting this shithole, attracted by the promise of quick wealth (so that they can own things, to boot), end up staying because they experience something they havent had in decades - or if younger - ever - true freedom of expression.Many of these people do rent and they dont own and arent set up to.

Some part of their chemically sedated, sleep-deprived brain will wonder,  Is this... Michlan poster genuinely interested in my best interest? Does Michlan really want me to be happy?  which will lead them to start wondering why they CANT own things -- starting with their phone, perhaps, which runs a closed source operating system or gets  healthcare  apps installed to it remotely.. or their car, which they learn they dont have  the right to repair  even though they diligently paid off their loan.

These spoiled, entitled idiots will find anything to complain about.,Fuck off faggot go sleep in a pod,Based,It is all true, though. Im not even gonna bother the seething people the rest of this thread.Literally just basic logic: if renting everything and living minimalist WAS objectively cheaper (which is the goal) then there should be no problem yes? Thats why I do not get that dumb meme. It boggles my mind.In fact if objectively renting was cheaper, you have more disposable income and happier, and more money to pass on to the next generation.Literally nobody could argue with this so 95% of this thread is just butthurt replies.,Renting a home equal to mine costs ~300€/week, I have to pay ~100€/year.Renting my car would cost ~200€/day, my car costs me about 100€/month, minus diesel which Id have to pay for with a rented car.With my home, I could immediately liquidate it for 300% more than I bought it for. My car isnt all that easy to liquidate, but a car is quite necessary where I live anyways, so I wouldnt want to, and would use it to move.What Im saying is, renting would be easily 10 times more expensive for me, than owning things. Even when I include hired help, spare parts, mechanics, renovations, etc. into the calculations.The only pro I can see of not owning anything, is that you can easily go to wherever you want, and just take your cash with you. However, thats also the downside. Youre a disposable worker who has no roots in the local area and has no ties to it. Frankly, you couldnt give a fuck who does what and where they do it at, youll just move to a place of your liking, and one day, those places dont exist anymore. Children, which you probably wouldnt want to have as theyre so expensive, would also suffer from your nomadic lifestyle. And of course, as you own nothing, youre extremely weak, and everything can be taken from you, and you can be banned from everywhere, and now youre left to the streets with nothing, nothing to buy, nothing to rent, nothing to eat, nothing to take shelter in, nothing to wear, and you will be happy.What are the odds of Kraken getting banned(more specifically in Canada)?

You literally have one simple job: buy some every week or month. You dont even need to look at the price, thats the whole point of dollar-cost average. You just keep buying a fixed amount in USD.

Also he deployed MySQL as open source. Then sold it for Billions once it got big. He knows marketing. Im skeptical about if this can work efficiently.

They are aiming for the moon but probably wouldnt have funding to get there.,Yea no, I dont think thats happening,The Idea by itself needs a huge thumbs up, the fact that CEO answers questions in the group in a relentless way, is also worthy of a huge thumbs up, other than that , the fact these dudes are serious about implementing such huge ambition is worthy of being honored for.,Who the fuck is that Saito guy ? There is nuffin on him when i google him,I hope they stay on their promises for delivering such huge project and its benefits that it brings to the mainstream public, If that happens ,We can say they have proven to be a revolution to edge-computing and computing in general.,Thats cool and all but I need to 1000x my money very quickly.,First introduced to computers at an early age in life at, 8 years old.Daniel took an natural affinity towards computers over the years. With his keen technical skills in computers. His past experiences varied from co-founding a Tokyo based ISP (RIMNET) to a security research engineer at NTT DoCoMo R D.As a serial entrepreneur, Danielhas played a pivotal role in several startups globally and specifically in Asia Pacific (APAC) region.Daniel joined MySQL in 2005, recruited as the Representative Director for MySQL K.K. He was one of the first employees for MySQL in the APAC region, he was tasked to educate and expand the open source business for the MySQL database.https://www.crunchbase.com/person/daniel-saitoI just copy and pasted what this website says, and ofc its not all what he has done though,I have no doubts they will eventually deliver, the question is when.

Most scams have low Mcap to please the shorters. Its postive thingAlso,Yeah, they have to get huge so fast , not letting other rivals get past them , that is the key nowadays, you think how hard is for other big tech giants to copy the Idea and implement it before strongnode gets enough traction ? they definitely can do so, or even they can throw stones on their way,I was wondering the same thing, what If other big tech giants step in and want to steal the idea ? I hope that does not happen , but even if that happens , I think strongnode would be able to get past that by having the first-mover advantage, so that being said , things should go as planned if you are concerned in that regard.,they are launching in 3 weeks. dont think anyone can beat them to market sooner than that.,Well said, but I think even if those big tech giants come in and even steal the idea, that would be a huge free advertisement for them, if they step in, this thing would be known to billions and billions of people causing them to be interested or at least get strongnode the attention it needs, that is going to be huge in either way, its a win-win game.,Not a problem though , I cant wait till they do what they say they wanna do.,One question, are they going have strongnode built upon their own blockchain or ... what ? I still dont know that lol,What is a nodeLearn 2 read nigger.,when presale curry niggas,Lmao, I know what is a node, what I asked was another question  nigger .,Its not easy to copy ideas, there are patents anon.,Its not easy for a small team, not for tech giants , hm ?,The dude is right, even for big tech giants , this things is not easy, even huge companies like LG failed in mobile phone industry, they are not immune to failure, but yes you are right, they can do so if they want to but its not likely , you know....,Then stake it you faggot,KEK is with us tonight.,Every project has the possibility of being a failure but that doesnt mean that this one will be like ICP,sacred 4 check. once we get more AMAs well have a better gauge if its legit or not,Its not easy for both.

Seems legit so far.,lol, might beYou are right, but we shouldnt say this with 100% certainty , though Im kinda a fan of strongnode, I like that happens, cause Im gonna be making the money, I dont care if ICP did that or what, what we all care is money, and secondly caring about the project.I hope so, Im excited for new announcements .,Hail Bune!,Lmao, yeah you are right, If theyve actually patented it in US, no one can fuck with them , so yeah... its all cool.,If the presale isnt done yet, why yall shilling this?I dont get it.Whats in it for you lot?,fined millionsfor a billions worth projectMuricans are fucked.,its legitimately exciting.

Saito directly stated the main competitors and their mcap. He also adressed the concerns regarding people stealing the concept but i dont remember that to well. If you havent you should join the telegram, even the mods are pretty intelligent and wont bullshit you. This is not the typical pajeet shitcoin,You know there is a quote which says  big stone means not hitting  which means , if you take a big stone(representing a big goal) and wanna hit the target(the destination you wanna be for being successful), youre most probably gong to fail. here we are talking about some technical difficulties , they may not be able to convince comanies who dont like strongnode to be run on their produced devices, they might occur to be faced with different lawsuits, they might run out of money, and all that... but one thing for sure, is , they must seek help from other teams and team up with other big tech or crypto teams to stay in the game. thats my 2 cents.,Hell yeah, thats why I love it so much, Im surrounded by intelligent people, not some dude who just fapped last night and wants to launch a coin lmaoooo,If the presale isnt done yet, why yall shilling this?I dont get it.Whats in it for you lot?,Yall weird ass faggots are giving blowjobs to eachother . It feels like I just got into a bit orgy session. But yeah the shit seems legit,people are talking about it...nobody told anyone to buy it,the captchas increased the quality of threads. Theres no constant fud everywhere and pajeet bots are btfo,we are discussing if this is a legit project. why are you posting this again and again/?,Looks like weve got some pretty intelligent people in this thread, thanks for your analysis , but one question, do you really wanna buy into this thing with all that is floating around your brain about the project ?,Im not that much intelligent haha, but yeah, I might buy some in their presale, or even if I didnt Im gonna keep my eyes on it, and buy some when it got listed on exchanges, I support this project not as a fan, cause being fan makes you not see some pitfalls, but more as a thinker and critic .,Look at me! You dont bet all your money on one horse daug. But if it seems legit you gotta keep your eyeholes open and watch it closely.,You are based anon, words of wisdom !,you gave him the right advice, that is basically what should be done but a lot of people lack at doing this one simple thing.,,Thanks guys, I know enough.This is a scam.,am to autistic, 4chan wont even captcha me,The whitepaper is neatly written , The CEO, knows actually what he talks about, overall, Im bullish on strongnode.,whitepaper isnt even out yet my nigga.,This could really change online gaming as we know it. massively reduced ping for everywhere. cant wait,based jannies,Can you remove daniels cock out of your throat and stop the cringe for a minute?So many inorganic shills in those threads Its the team trying to hype the ico so they can raise max money,Oh sorry, I meant litepaper., most crypto projects evade from answering questions, ironically this is how you spot rugpulls.

Only the litepaper is out yet,Lmao, man, what is the key to your clarity ? is it just faps or when you only fap in the sake of strongnnode ?,Stop, its getting corny now,how do i buy when it is available,Jesus Christ will you ever stfu about fapping,About 3 weeks from now,yes but how and in what currency where,Lmao, you better tell , stop talking about fapping, plus  who actually choose the adj  faptastic  for strongnode LMAO,They havent released the list of where can you buy it. You can join their telegram group to get more updates,Sometimes i hate you niggers. Now calm down and lets asks Daniel how he plans to implement this shit to TVs,we get it youre a coomer but please can you stop telling us? its fucking disgusting,Cool thread, faggots. Any chance of an actual discussion here? When is the presale? What are the minimum requirements to run a node? Side note, when is Saito going to hold another AMA? if a single one of you tells me youre jerking off, Im going all in on ICP purely out of spite,Stop going into this threads if youre only going to talk about cooming assholes,These coomers are ruining the thread,ICP is decent buy right now desu.Presale in 3 weeks, no details as of yet.Saito said something about raspberry pi running nodes, Deploying linux first then MacOS, Windows etc..Saito next AMA in 15thAnd yea, im jerking off to some hapa futa,COOMERS GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY THREAD REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE,Presales is still 3 weeks away and the exact announcements will be made soon by Saito,I reckon he was joking when he said about rasberry pi but I cant be soo sure,Saito san please give us bullish news,I am not Saito san I am demon spawn,,Tell Saito san when release,Launch in 3 weeks. Theres a TG for price discussion. you should check it out.,Woah I missed that one amigo . Thats whats up! . We get to run nodes on Raspberry Pi now!,He says you need to sacrifice 3 virgins at midnight in a cemetery to know the release date.,I can sacrifice your virgin ass for more bullish news,Get ready to bag your nodes with Raspberry Pi,Based,Who was on this project from cardano?,Manmeet singh. Vice Chairperson. Another smart jeet.,I really want this project to be legit. Ive been following their telegram for the daily dose of hopium, and it all looks good so far; but I really want to see Saito address the potential security issues in the next AMA,Because itll never die, anon. We have anons getting rugpulled everyday with projects with no use cases here but overlook one of the most unruggable tokens that started DeFi summer and whos dev is actively working to deploy on Polygon and Balancer v2,But nobody believes in this coin anymore, even though it has great system...Day 23 of snailposting every day until BTC is at $100k.,cute snail(̶a̶s̶ ̶a̶ ̶m̶i̶l̶l̶i̶o̶n̶a̶i̶r̶e̶) (as a billionaire)How does he do it?,white girls are addicted to the BAC (Big Asian Cock),How the fuck do I cope that this guy is so much smarter than me? His life is so easy (rich parents, SV higherup, crypto billionaire, million-dollar businesses).I actually cant take this. Im only worth 7 figs while this fucker is worth 9.,He bought $ZNN, lol,Hes not a billionaire until it hits 1000,implying this isnt going to happen.Being an office wagie is soooo comfy, its minimal work for a ton of money.Why doesnt the USA simply outlaw Monero?,they want you to have your fun and get used to digital currencies before they roll out their own after which they outlaw the rest,its basically unavailable on any regulated exchanges, and probably wont be long before its on no centralized exchange at all. they can probably kill monero, but they wont be able to kill whatever second-layer privacy scheme replaces it.,Many regulated CEXs have Monero.,in the us? kraken and thats it.,This. Its on Kraken, is it not?I never understood why Monero is supposed to be under higher threat of illegality than other crypto. Because you cant see who sends how much where? Thats true for literally every currency to ever exist. Money has to be private. If crypto cant be private, it can never evolve into money (in which case we should skip straight to nuclear omnicide, the preferable alternative to global communism).,OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHH SAAAAAAAAAAYYYYY CAAAAAAN YOUUUUU SEEEEEEEEfreedumbAmericans are untermensch,money first must be valuable to be useful, and moneros value is entirely dependant on its technology keeping up with new attacks and better privacy technologies. its destined to die at some point, but its useful today, yeah.,Why outlaw it when you can track it. How do you think they found McAffee?,Monero right now is the spearhead of crypto development. If theres one coin thats getting future proofed, its XMR. If quantum computers ever come out of the vaporware stage, theyll be used to encrypt as much as for decryption. In such a scenario, even a full zk-starks implementation becomes feasible. Uncrackable.,I love how the xmr shills are fucking everywhere here.,I dont like thing, therefore anyone who does like thing is a shill,Not shilling, its genuinely the best cryptocurrency in that its the only digital cash project that is being adopted commercially. Its inches away from going 51% on total trade volume of all DNMs. Vendors love it. Immutable anonymous digital cash, everything crypto ever needed to be.,xmr is stateof the art. you cant deny that.,I love how people pretending to understand money totally missed the part where it has to be fungible. Seriously, Monero is the only real cryptocurrency.,Fuck off with this 2014 meme coin. It objectively died in 2017 as a meme. My biggest mistake of my entire crypto life was no selling xmr for btc around 2017.,chasing greenngmi,Why doesnt the USA simply outlaw Monero?same reason zoomers cant stop fapping about big black cocks....they simply cant,BTC is an overleveraged shitcoin that missed the mark by several parsecsWe need digital cash, nothing less, money without any influence from any third party whatsoever, not the whole SoV settlement layer fiasco shit sandwich that is being served up by maxi assholes and DeFi cultists.,Russia did it so why cant USA do the same?,It didnt miss it was steered off the mark. Somebody must have gotten to some of the devs in the first few years. It doesnt make sense how far off it started going compared to the original vision.,Fuck off with your 2014 meme coin. I was into it when you were still a child. Nobody gives a single shit in 2021 about 100% anonymity since its all about the normies getting defi when it gets to alts but even alts die left and right anyway since they are too many including eth and bnb and others.,Sure just like they outlawed meth, heroin, cocaine, weed, lsd etc...,You are correct. That somebody is called AXA and Blockstream. They crippled BTC by refusing to increase its block size, bullied opposing devs out of the project, and began collecting investments for producing for-profit layer-2 chains that  solve  this ridiculous artificial scale ceiling. Now Bitcoin carries the value proposition of the compromise coin, fulfilling the promise of crypto on paper but not in reality. Wet dream of bankers that do not believe in crypto and want to retain their influence. Ponzi of our time.,its all about the normiesWrong, followers of trends are enders of trends. defiNothingburger. XMR will dwarf it in market cap before long.,This i agree withThis how people talk when theyre in a cult,Trust me bro: the PEDOPHILES will pump my bags.Besides: this meme is older than the mountains.There is way more potential in newer shitcoins.,Its hard to argue. The XMR dev team is almost as big and well funded as those of BTC and ETH. The latter two are tilted and have severe difficulties implementing any sort of change. Taproot delayed, EIP1559 and ETH2 delayed, delays delaying delays of very crucial upgrades while XMR got bulletproofs, Dandelion, soon Tryptich, atomic swaps (ironically as ETH rollups), and the list wont end. XMR doesnt have the market cap or liquidity to match, but that can change. There are no sacred cows.,This how people talk when theyre in a cultwhat can i say other than im following all of the pull requests that are made to moneros github project and i dont see any other crypto project coming close to what those guys are doing.,This, Monero already obsolete,the PEDOPHILESFungibility and confidentiality wont be sacrificed due to a handful of bad actors. Children can be protected without destroying the rightful privacy of innocents.,BTC and ETH are not good enough to be compared to XMRb-but mcapMeaningless in the long term, doubly meaningless in a grotesquely overleveraged market,Anyone looking for a cunnycoin is already buying DOT,They would eventually, but doing so until now would have resulted in free marketing for the coin.They dont care if you make money off speculating on it, they want it to be more obscure so criminals dont use it., Believing the government when it suits your narrative.Or is it that if technology is complicated enough for you not to understand it you just assume the glowies have a magic backdoor? Why is it only Zcash trannies who claim they can track Monero in years old articles that dont amount to anything? You realize its open source - if there were fatal flaws your magical government would have to be preventing every cryptographer in the world for pointing them out to warn people?,You can buy XMR on Kraken with a lowes Amex card and get cash back for the t re ansaction.http://refer.amex.us/STEPHBJXj1?xl=cp105t,thats true for literally every currencyt.: retardBanks have to comply with legal requests for transfer surveillance.And if youre talking about cash... you are more correct, but its still not even close to what currencies like Monero offer. For example, you cant legally move large amounts of cash across national borders without declaring.,I used to be pro xmr but I realized it cant be justified with the network weakness, BTC will be a compromise and looking at the great tech thats developing XMR will soon be pretty much useless anyway, after taproot CoinSwap is going to be amazing and I cant imagine other privacy features, of which probably ring signatures are going to be developed.,banning monero is like banning weapons. normal people use them but criminals also do too, but normal people also need to protect themselves from criminals,t. 60 IQ mouthbreather,Go to r/darknet and tell the OPSEC vets there everything you just said here.,/biz/ in 2021 treats xmr the exact same way normies treated bitcoin a decade agosuch a shithole kekremember always do the opposite of what /biz/ says,Why doesnt the USA just nuke itself repeatedly until its been wiped off the face of this earth?,weak, optional privacy can replace Monero,Why not do it ourselves? They lost to a bunch of rice farmers so i shouldnt be to hard to kill them all.,it absolutely can in 99.99% of the use cases if monero cant scale for shit.,Because those kikes have nuclear trinity. We need to get them to kill themselves,Kill yourself retard,Devs killed Monero once they banned ASIC miners. No one is mining this piece of shit today and its fucking sad as I loved this coin so much,Lol, thats what saved it from utter devastation. You lack understanding,Literally just invade US cities and start shooting citizens. Its that easy.,im just saying right now monero has a realistic cap of less than 100k active users after that you start losing parts of the world. probably incapable of scaling above 1 million active users even on good broadband.,I dont give a shit. Go shill your  optional  horseshit somewhere else,because its useless. when the only way to buy crypto is through regulated exchanges monero  privacy  is meaningless. they still know how much monero you bought, they know how much you withdraw and you are still liable for taxes, and no  I lost my xmr in a boating accident  wont work,No, they just proved Monero is centralized aka devs can do whatever and miners dont decide anything. They broke consensus and the coin has been dead since then,or you can suck my dick and swallow like the good little sissy you are.,How fast are XMR transactions?,The glowies use it too,who cares? we are going to moon soon!!,Isnt that just USDC?,its decent, 2 minute blocks, but when you receive wallet may not let you spend for a good while until you have a plausible privacy set available.,not reallynothing stopped miners from revolting and creating a monero classic just like eths shitty forksfact is we trust the monero devs, they make good decisions,This thread glows. Fucking misleading nigger kike pieces of shit, kill yourselves.,nooooooooooooooooooooooooo you have to let chinks control 99.99999% of all the nodes!!!1111,The only reason youd want to hide your monetary transactions is if youre doing shady shit.,Please post a screenshot of all of your debit/credit card transactions from June, please. Id like to check them out.,if your bank already offers you privacy what you need monero for?,In the last century the US outlawed alcohol knowing full well it was unenforceable and as a consequence enabled organized crime. Followed by that the US outlawed drugs, and turned a dying Latin American industry into one of the biggest in the world.Banning does not work. If they did the convoluted laws of the universe would pump my bags from break it to generational wealth.,why dont mutts outlaw the internetit would be the same as when they put trade sanctions on countries then get laughed at because no one listens to them, i think the us is trying to avoid further embarrassment,To buy 4chan premium?,Fiat is trash but fungibility isnt. Everyone with  dirty  BTC will be in a bad position one day,How do you prove something is shady? If you really think the govt makes laws while keeping the well-being of its citizens in its mind, then youre probably a retarded NPC. For instance, I can buy cocaine in Portugal in cash but I cant do that in the most US states.,the difference is monero isnt drugs. people arent addicted to monero, people wont spend all their savings for their monero cravings. if all cash on ramps for monero were banned it basically becomes worthless. they might not be able to ban the network but they can definitely destroy its price,The same thing that happened to alcohol and drugs wont happen to monero. Because it has no demand like those commodities. But yeah, Monero isnt bannable.,or your government is shady shit,Monero isnt bannableit is in multiple ways. unless you approach it all from a different angle.,Monero is used all over the world for money laundering and other shady shit. It wont affect the price even a lil bit if the US bans it. Yeah some retarded normies would give in into that FUD and lower its price a bit but it wont affect it in long term. They will have to ban it on a global scale by lobbying for the laws through embargos and shit like that, which would sour relations with some countries. Tl;dr: YOU CANT FUCKING BAN MONERO,How? If I can buy it, keep it in a wallet and use to buy things(even if I would be imprisoned for it), it isnt banned according to me. If youre talking about just some  law , which makes it a crime to deal with monero, then yeah, they CAN ban it.,I heavily disagree. Your argument makes XMR even more useful. When CEXs already link purchases and withdrawal addresses to your name having untraceable transactions is a must for any reasonable privacy. Its by no means a perfect solution but its by far the best one right now.,its a good thing monero is coming out with atomic swaps to bitcoin then so you dont need an exchange you just need a buyer or seller,monero is the real bitcoin cashlike cash its untracable,can you tell me the name of that country that its government likes tax evasion? yeah there is none. they will all ban it and the fact that none of them has only proves nobody even uses it for them to care,if you have no liquidity to trade for goods and services and the financial layer giving crypto valuation is completely co-opted then your coin inevitably goes to $0 as no rational human being would want to hold it.also you cant run a node without the authorities finding you if the nodes can find each other. you can make it a bit hard, but they can actually ban the protocol. they can even ban i2p altogether and jam thor full of honeypots if it isnt already.,also read about trisa and kyv if you want the same pit inside your stomach i have recently.they can even deprivatize privacy coins by attaching full sender and beneficiary identity info on a sidechain for every tx if you planning on selling on an exchange (or anyone you would sell it to would be planning on selling on an exchange),CIA uses it to money launder their drug trade gains.,Why doesnt the USA simply outlaw its own honeypot?gee, I wonder why,This would be an insane black swan event. I cant imagine that any first world country would ban any decentralized protocol. At most they would ban specific nodes if they where directly involved in something clearly illegal. Banning Monero from exchanges is also something that would seem unreasonable, and if it were to happen it would be decisive for the fate of all of crypto. However, minor regulations that would make exchanges themselves choose to delist XMR is likely (which currently is happening).,There was recently a huge hack that brought down grocery stores for days in Europe. They wanted ransom in XMRI suppose I can look forward to a story of how those hackers were traced via their money transactions?,Because your bank is a piece of shit that might freeze your account for political reasons,fortunately I dont live in a third world country,/pol/ is so dumb it hurts,how about changenow.io?,fuck off,You have to go back.,its because its the true good crypto. not for brainlets. its all grassroots.,Because they cant.,if you have no liquidity to trade for goods and services and the financial layer giving crypto valuation is completely co-opted then your coin inevitably goes to $0 as no rational human being would want to hold it.How would that happen? No ones gonna stop accepting Monero and even if that happens there are other uses of it, like money laundering or even just speculating and swing trading. No ones gonna invest in real estate because theres a 0.000000001% possibility of the govt outlawing it.,also you cant run a node without the authorities finding you if the nodes can find each other. you can make it a bit hard, but they can actually ban the protocol. they can even ban i2p altogetherCan you fucking read properly? They will have to do that on a global scale to completely ban monero. Which I explained clearly how its near impossible to do that. Not everyone who uses Monero lives in US or just one country in particular.,Whos this  they  youre referring to? Devs arent gonna do that, thats for sure and govt CANT do that.,The US cant unless it just wants to drop the mask of being a  fair democracy  and just skip right into the  socialist totalitarian nightmare  that it desperately wants to be. How would they even enforce a Monero ban without literally going into your house and surveilling you 24/7?It would be a bigger government blunder than the alcohol prohibition in the 1920s.,they will all ban it Yeah, like how they banned drugs and and right? the fact that none of them has only proves nobody even uses it for them to careNot everyone is that retarded to not use it like you.,and alcohol*,when the only selling point of your shitcoin is  criminals use it  you already lost,stop investing*,Yeah? drugsonly criminals consume itsomehow, I can still just go to a dark alley downtown and buy it,their core technology reliant on ring signatures has been rotting away without replacement for years now, it really isnt. its not even at the  spearhead  or privacy. its going to be a rude awakening for you guys if you still believe moneros been keeping up with anything.,yeah its a bit harder to control all dark alleys than to control a centralized internet. your monero tokens are worthless if you cant cash out. I would love to see you go into a dark alley and cash out thousands of dollars in monero with a random guy you found on craigslist,,if you believe block size is scaling, or capable of  un-crippling  bitcoin, then its no wonder you believe monero to be some beacon of technology.ponzito believe that a coin launched as monero did doesnt fit the description more than an un-relaunchable bitcoin, really exposes you. too bad you missed the boat on early crypto, but this level of coping isnt healthy.,You realize all of your activity on the internet has been surveiled by the NSA for more than a decade now? Unless you have been 100% airtight with a VPN, they know you are into monero. If/when it is outlawed, expect a knock on your door.,and fundamentally, when all monero has left is  atomic swaps  with bitcoin, its got nothing to keep it around over better privacy technologies. the cost to switch a dark market from monero to something more modern is trivial when youre forced to cash out via swaps with bitcoin anyway.,Yeah I guess if people cant cash out it, they will ditch monero. But every country will have to do that to successfully ban it. Youre just overseeing things just to prove your point. Or are you just retarded?,But every country will have to do that to successfully ban itYou must be delusional if you think that wont happen. They will all ban it either by their own will or after they get a phone call by uncle Sam,I think Adam Back is one of the ones who was gotten to somehow. Not one of the ones who was doing the getting. Axa might be the ones. I have a feeling there are even more sinister people behind it all. Straight up schizo illuminati type of shit.But yeah those are some of the events that I was referring to.,,Yeah, youre beyond delusional. And as other anon said even if every country bans it, atomic swaps exists and you cant track whos mining monero anyway. So, you literally cant ban it.,do you even read my posts? I already said they cant ban the network, but they can definitely destroy its price and make it illiquid and worthless. Have fun holding those worthless bags I am sure eventually el Chapo and Al Qaeda will buy your bags,dont worry they already know how to crash any crypto network permanently,they can definitely destroy its price and make it illiquid and worthlessHow would they do that? Do YOU read my posts?,simply banning it from all exchanges, all cash on ramps and all merchants from accepting it would completely destroy its price, at least 95% dump. And no, being banned wont make it more valuable because its not a fucking drug,I think only third world countries freeze accountsAnon, you need to take the red pill or else... ngmi,simply banning it from all exchangesDeFi, DEX and Atomic Swaps exist.all merchants from acceptingNo one uses it buy anything legal anyway. it would completely destroy its price, at least 95% No it wont happen because, people will still use it to launder money by using Atomic Swaps, people will still swing trade(maybe not as many people as now) and dark web markets will still use it.Perfectly on track.

The cost of eating out was up 0.7% overall. We now see broad-based inflation across our various commodities, packaging materials, and transportation costs,  Nestlés CEO, Mark Schneider, said on a call with analysts in April.  Not all of these items can be hedged, and our hedging cover for a number of commodities will run out over time. We are raising prices where appropriate. Some experts are expecting these price hikes to go on well into 2022.,When I start looting that shit will cost $0, its no problem homie.,What? But my 4th of July BBQ costs were down this year!,go to same wholesale store the guys who own vending machines go toget a box of snickers and a box of salt and vinegar chips (the only 2 things I ever get) thats enough to last me for months for less than a quarter of the price of a vending machineIts never made sense to me how wholesalers exist in plain sight and restaurants/grocery stores buy from them and then inflate the prices, but nobody actually ever goes to a wholesaler themselves. For things like chocolate bars or chips with basically infinite shelf lives, its not like theyre going to go bad because you had to buy so much,Fat people are retarded. In other news, water is wet and op is a faggot.,By $0.16 according to cherrypicked data from the BLS. I actually checked at the store and pork chops are WAY more expensive. The trick they use is hedonic adjustments. Those Premium Bushs Beans are up $1? No problem, well just change CPI to use generic knockoff beanz that also went up $1 but are still $0.05 less than Bushs was a year ago. No inflation here guys, baked beans prices are down!!!!Meanwhile propane costs are through the roof, good luck with that BBQ,Snacks and drinks are free in office,The writing is on the wall for anyone that has an IQ over 120. Food security is dropping like a rock, and this time next year a record amount of Americans will be lining up to food banks or going hungry.Do not panic. Buy extra dry goods on your weekly trips. Flour, rice and dried beans with spices can go a long way; frozen veggies and some canned goods can keep for a long time as well. Do not wait for the news to make it explicit. At the very least youll have piece of mind knowing if things get bad you have at least a few weeks of food set aside.,Premium Bushs Beansyour point is probably valid but holy shit lol. Bushes beans are absolutely disgusting. When did baked beans become beans swimming in fucking maple syrup. Way way way too fucking sweet, like many american food products desu.,Also, say if a block of cheese 1 year ago was 700g for $5, and now its 500g for $5, they dont count that as inflation. Same with 6 chicken breasts - 5 for the same price (basically any decreasing quantity).,Yeah just an example, they do it to everything, not just food. Crest toothpaste prices go up? Hedonic adjustment to an  equivalent  walgreens knockoff that is a few cents less. But the worst is what they do with cars ( quality  adjustments) and real estate ( owner equivalent rent ),The problem is, how do I dig up these resources? Most people dont have direct connections to wholesalers, and some will only sell to retailers,Theyre technically supposed to, but dont. Pic related is 15% inflation at Costco. Same price, same apparent size. They just make the center cardboard roll bigger and the normies dont notice. The tricks never end,Yeah real estate is the worst. When you think about it, theres nothing stopping them from setting the price they want. I had a new management company take over my building (yes Im a rentie) and my rent is going up $150/month just because Im signing a new lease. No warning, no options, just  fuck you, pay me .

As a landlord myself I almost never raise rent on my tenants because its almost never worth it. If the tenant leaves thats at least one month of vacancy. Thats like a 9% hit to your yearly revenue and it could easly be two months of vacancy if you have a hard time finding a good tenant, so 18% hit to the yearly revenue. These fuckers must be very confident they can get another tenant immediately because the math doesnt work out otherwise.4 more days.,Until what?,they already unlocked 10k btc these last 3 days in theory, the price only tanked about $2kwhere the fuck is the gigadump that you niggers promised me?,Until you can buy the largest BTC trustfund again, which is currently trading at a discount. https://grayscale.com/products/grayscale-bitcoin-trust/Theyll spot buy billions worth of BTC.

Just wow.,Coomageddon,already priced in,Youve been falling for the fud. Let me break it down real simple: 1) There are no BTC getting unlocked that could be sold, customers are just able to sell their own shares. If you dont believe me, there are prior unlocks which all did nothing.2) On the 18th greyscale will sell shares again and right now they are at a discount, this basically means that they are guaranteed to go up.3) For every share they greyscale sells then will have to spot buy BTC (which they cant sell) and they will have to buy a LOT of BTC.

I put a small amount in KandySwap but the token itself has lost 50% and I havent even earned +10% tokens yet. Also saw they got a High Risk audit. Looked at some of the others that got listed on vfat and none seem as appealing as Kudex. But Im very open to hedging my bets just in case..,Kandy seems very sketchy to me. Koffee may be legitimate but as an investment Im not buying the bags of the top 10 holders with 50%+ of the supply to dump; the platform will probably succeed long term but its financially unsound.

Middle management who realize that the only reason their job exists is because people came into the office and with out in person work they literally have fuck all to do.,serendipitous,pretty much. coworkers and manager spend 2 hour bitching about the other departments.everyfuckingday,women shouldnt have rights, prove me wrong,I want to get back to the office and I want my little worms in with me so I can get back to micromanaging them.

Bitch doesnt even know what prefrontal cortexes do.,Because Chad misses fucking his interns. Of course you incels dont know anything about that.,Hey guys, I know I am seeing a lot of back-and-forth on this topic, but I really need to push back and raise some red flags here. Having an on-site office presence foundational to our ability to drive efficiencies in a corporate landscape. It is in our DNA. Sure, there is no one size fits all or silver bullet and some are just boilerplate solutions, leveraged to the hilt and really only keeping us at a 30,000-foot-view of things. Being on-site, however, really allow us to get better granularity, find better directional-indicators, or loop back and dive deep into some critical issues on a go-forward basis.I think if you all start spending more time in the office gain, youll find yourself trending toward the positive, but youll have to keep an eye on the puck. Gut through it, reduce thrash, and lets stay in lock-step on this. Yes, we will synergize!Whats the root cause of the hatred of Corporate office spaces? Ill put my laymans hat on and guess that it comes from movies such as Office Space and Dilbert cartoons. But we all know that these are fictional spaces, and real office spaces allow us to touch base in a much more efficient manner.I have to time-box this comment, as I have a hard-stop in a moment when I will have to jump onto a call. So, just one more point that I want to cover-off on: lets socialize the idea of having more office presence and loop back to see whether were being more impactful. From a management standpoint, I think that we can get the traction to do it.So, net/net, ignore the naysayers, sidebar the folks that are stuck in the weeds, and dont waste cycles or bandwidth on folks that dont align strongly with this mission. Try it out, and well have another touch point in a little while to see if weve moved the needle. Remember, our north star hasnt changed. Were still championing our core values remotely and we will only do it better in person.If you need me, I will be online again in a bit.,This might sound crazy coming from someone on an anime website but there are actual people in this world that have social desires and dont want to be glued to a screen and working in isolation 8-12 hours per day.,Have you considered that it’s not real socialization and is weird submissive game for the benefit of your employer?,this,WHY DO NORMIES WANT TO GO BACK TO THE OFFICE SO BADLY?because they have no lives and are extroverted.,Literally a fabricated conversation orchestrated by the jewish agenda.,being able to talk to people face to face is not real socializationI msut have forgot what website I was on for a second.,social desires I need a job to make friends Lol,High IQ anon has entered the chat,double 8 of truth,If you rely on a job for your  social desires  you have no social life. Sorry!,Nobody said you need a job to make friends autismo. Most people with jobs however prefer to have friends at work instead of showing up to the wage cage and being alone for hours.,Wait you actually work the entire fucking day remotely? Jesus dude,Yes same here. At least working remote allows those conversations to be over email or zoom call which I can easily ignore.,Normies like to socialise as opposed to being productive. They like to talk shit about each other behind backs. Fucking lame. women should be at home, not in the workforce.,Dont need to, because you are correct, king,Not everyone commits clock time fraud, Tyrone.,were set to go back to the cage  2-3 days a week  aka itll be a slow bleed to 5 days a week in the office once normie middle managers remember how much they love lording over their nigger cattle subjects irl. im interviewing for 2 remote jobs, one on thursday and one on friday. if i dont get one of them, i might literally fucking snap.,I dont work 100% of it I just have set hours where I need to be able to respond. Spend any off time playing vidya or browsing 4chin, but I can sort of sympathize with normies who actually want to see real people again.,he cant stand being in the place he made for himself, his own homeyou might want to fix your life.,are these even real people? could be shills trying to create a false consensus that everyone wants to return to the office. normies are highly suggestible to adopting opinions and mindsets that they believe are normal. so if you want people back in the office just release the shills and the bots and the shills that release bots and have them all talk about how great it would be to be back in the office. normies will then adopt and repeat almost word for word what the shills fed to them.the same way some retards on /biz/ are falling for scam coins thinking they are /biz/ popular coins,thisI actually just got myself a fully wfh job. My new company realized during the pandemic that productivity actually went up because people liked working from home, had more time for themselves etc. Now all my colleagues are very professional and dont need to be managed so that helps.,just pay a couple hundred a month to go chill at a WeWork then. Or work from a fancy cafe or something,I have poor executive functionI am literally retarded guys, lets go back into the office,they have no clue what life could be anon.,Sure maybe they want to work in the office in their media bullshit company.

It’s what work from home culture always turns into. If you don’t know that then you haven’t ever done it before,Wasnt really feeling it the first time you posted nor the second. Maybe third times the charm,Women do not work, the chat and socialize in offices,I miss the commuteDo normies really?,Nvm I just read your other posts. You’re just seem like a bitter wagie who hates his job and would rather sit at home all day pretending to work but still collecting paychecks. Whats it like being an anti social millennial freeloader?,its not too late to fix your life. you hate being in your own home. your social life is so stunted that you need forced interactions for a minimum of 8 hours a day. theres a whole world out there. you just need to  get out of your shell,  so to speak.,Where in any of my posts did I say I was the one who wanted/needed the social interaction from coworkers? Why are you speaking to me as if I said something I didnt? Im simply just explaining that some people prefer actually physically being around other people.,conditioning they have been conditioned for decades slaves will always remember their chains,i have a fancy corporate job at a publicly traded company with a lot of responsibility, a lot of face time with VPs/directors, and a decent salary. im sorry youre an undisciplined, inefficient retard who apparently cant work unless some kike is breathing down his neck, with no apparent friends outside of the wage cage. fix your life before its too late.,That point is lost on people who are loners but larp as well adjusted adults on the internet.,The real reason is that wagies like to keep work and home separate for some reason.,And yet you have time to argue with a bunch of anons on 4chan, coping about how some people like to actually be around others instead of being a loner kek. Stop larping faggot,You dont even have to work from home. You can go to the park, go to the coffee shop etc. Why would you rather be at the office rather than have the freedom to work from where ever you want? Youre working remotely, you can travel, go anywhere and work.,wake upeatworkeatworkeatworksleepad infinitumsleep forever,im 8:40 AM EST retard, i dont turn my work laptop on until 9:00 AM. thats the benefit of working from home. i just do whatever the fuck i want until 9:00 AM sharp, instead of jumping in a car to sit in subhuman nigger cattle traffic for 30-60 minutes each way.,he thinks high pay jobs means youre actively working harder/longeroh no no no no,Thats not true at all, it only turns into that if you allow it and you act spineless. If there is a fucking emergency sure, thats what salary is for, but if you have a hard stop at 5, then you have a hard stop. Like, i have a soft hour before from 7-8 where i will casually check my emails for if something goes wrong or to get a start of the day, then work from 8-5. 5-6 i have another soft hour where i will casually check emails and unless its a fucking emergency i dont deal with it or tell them yep we can do it tomorrow. What you are describing is a issue with the working not being able to go  lol no i work from 5-8. ,desu I like to do that as well, which is why I just turn off the computer at 17h sharp every day unless something really bad comes up right before that. You just need to teach your coworkers that you have a life outside work and that they can fuck right off if they ask you for stuff outside your working hours.,Thats crazy bro what are your shift hours like? Thats gotta be like 14 hours a day 7 days a week.,Ok, get back in your cagie.,What? I didnt say I was the one that wanted to go back perhaps you should reread my post.,getting this butthurtBro chillax, the internet isnt serious business. Were all returning to the offices eventually either way when a controversy about programmers taking like 20 jobs at the same time starts showing up on the news, forcing people to show up at least once in a designated office just to prove that youre not multi job drifting. That or whatever other reason theyll come up with. Just go with the flow, theres no point in being angry at returning to normal schedule,the worst part about this is that youre probably right,NORMIES MAKE ME FUCKING SICK,looks like a swarm of shills working from a troll farm trying to sway public opinion, no one wants to go back to the office,Underrated,returning to normal scheduleYep, we need to do things the  normal  way, which means doing them exactly the same way weve been doing them for decades. Even though weve realized we could change things and have more flexibility and less stress doesnt mean we should. That wouldnt be  normal.  We have to just keep doing things the same way forever because thats normal.,Kek exactly. People fight on this board so hard for permanent WFH it’s kind of weird. Like you hate working in an office that badly? Maybe you need a new job that doesn’t have such a shit office culture. Everyone I know in reality who wants perm WFH only wants it so they can lay around in sweatpants all day pretending to work and then going grocery shopping in the afternoon. They’re just lazy wage thieves,when a slick jewish executive says  lessons learned  from muh coof, they mean everything except the feasibility of working remotely. ive been working remotely since april 2020 yet we are being forced back into the cage on a hybrid basis, come august. really makes you (((think.))),My company went lol yeah work from home none of my co workers are even in my city anymore. Our company basically fully embraced it and went fuck it.,but there are actual people in this world that have social desiresI dunno, sounds pretty gay desu,this. People can contact me during work hours via my work communication. If theres a real emergency, they have to call my private phone (and this happens like once a year tops). These cucks need to grow a spine.,I am someone with poor executive function   the external structure imposed by going to an office is incredibly helpful in keeping me accountable at work and staying productive. Plus, I like seeing people, having someone else pay for my climate control, and office lunchesTHESE PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO VOTE,When Im home, I can do my work in two hours a day without commuting. When Im at the office, I can do my work in two hours as well, but have to pretend to work instead of doing something pleasant for the rest of the day while also having to commute. WFH just means more free time for me (without even any disadvantage for my employer, Im just fast at what Im doing). Why would I want to give that up?,my coworkers were my best friendsyikes,tfw woeking for a passport app company and doing everything I can to sabatoge itturns out with our IBM contract, IBM still doesnt know what we have access toDont worry senpai, everyone is sabotoging this shit from the group up, if your country doesnt have a nartionalized healthcare system glhf,been back in the workplace since summer last yearshit pay and too dum to programI hate every day of my life,And what is the government who can print fiat at will and erode our savings and keep moving the goal post on assets like housing? If we are lazy wage thieves what are they?,This is good for you you dope.,unironically, these are people whose jobs doesnt involve any actual real work,This is insane. In DC area and WFH has cut out 2-3 hour daily commute to/from work. My coworker was actually bitching about this the other day,  Like when do I listen to podcasts now?  BRO REALLY?,Thismost social media is fake,Cuck,PODCAST TIMEF-F-F-FUCK YEAH!!!!!,Notice how theyre nearly all women?Almost like women do fuck all actual work and instead use work as a way to bitch about other people and also so they have people to bitch about outside of work.Women dont have hobbies. These days they have social media and pretty much nothing else, so it shouldnt really come as a surprise women want to return to the office just so they can come home and whinge about Karen.Meanwhile most guys actually need to concentrate on their work because it requires some level of thought and would rather not be dragged into office birthday parties for colleagues they never talk to interrupting their actual work.,Its rose tinted, theyre border line retarded and dont remember the thousand little things they themselves hated about commuting and office life. All they think about is that time that birthday cake was brought in and it was tasty, that inserting podcast from a year back, and that funny joke Bob told like 3 years ago. Drop them back in and in a month I guarantee theyll deeply regret having to go back to the office, but these are the retards pushing for it and ruining it for everyone else, since when companies pull people back in theyll likely not be giving out WFH in the same capacity again.,I imagine theyre tired of being at home all day with their significant other. I know the consoomer demographic here is content with playing vidya all day but these are the types of people who enjoy going out with friends and throwing parties,I’m also in DC area it takes me 20 mins to get to the office. You must live in ashburn or something. Stop being poor and living in the middle of nowhere,Women largely climb the professional ladder by socializing, not by their work. Working from home handicaps that, hence why they push for a return to the office.,They can do that faggot shit on their own time, though,I listen to podcasts when I do shit like a normal human being,If you have time to socialize at your workThere are only 2 optionsYour work is uselessYou own the companySimple as.,Because they do what they think others will think is cool, but thats only what they are told.,Yeah, 2 hour commutes one way to work really do a great job of letting you spend more time with friends YOU FUCKING RETARD.I used to get home at 7. Now I can leave home at 6 to hang out with friends on a Friday. See, I have ACTUAL friends and dont get all my social interaction with colleagues. Hell, I can even get paid to fuck my wife during work hours. Women largely climb the professional ladder by socializing, not by their work.Holy shit youre right.,anon doesnt synergize with his colleagues This is what happens when you dont have a firm handshake with your office comrade. The dream cant be shared between coworkers when separated, thus weakening the drive of the individual worker. See? Together, people become stronger in the corporate landscape. An office that allows workers to WFH exclusively are doomed to lose their vision.,Duh. why do you think its HR mostly pushing this shit.Why do you think HR is mostly full of poofs and women.,Fuck, let me just check myself.,You still get breaks doing wfh. You still only work 8 hours. You even save time by not having to commute. Just socialize after work.,one of my coworkers asked why I never turn on the webcam. I told him mine is taped off because of hackers. In reality Im naked in bed and I dont feel like showing my face to these fucks. Why do these normies want to see you so badly? Work is about work, thats it,Why do these normies want to see you so badly? Work is about work, thats itmeetings are the most counterproductive part of my job. just drop everything and waste an hour in idle chit chat, its like these niggers never experienced a work flow state,lmao this.I got praised by my boss just for simply NOT doing that when the opportunity arose. Normally I keep my mouth shut, but it was a question directed at me and I just handled it professionally. An hour later Im getting a phone call about how patient I am and how my efforts are being noticed (Ive done almost literally no work in the last 15 months).Tomorrows my first day in the office... Not looking forward to it.,I dont hate the office. But even if your commute is only 30 minutes that is still one extra hour you have in the day. Plus the savings in gas and car maintenance.,% women and 10% soiboyThese people don’t actually work. Work is more like adult day care club for them, that’s why they want to go back,This imagine working 8 hours a day, then just being ok with giving them ANOTEHR hour that you dont get paid for in a commute, AND having to pay for gas for that.,because on remote , managers can actually see whos working and who isnt. Its squeaky clean data.In office wagies can lick their managers boots all day and not spend an hour doing actual work.Normies who fell into marry and reproduce meme realised they dont actually want to spend time with their partner or children, and actually would rather spend 3 hours on rush hour traffic + 8 hours in office.Middle management had to actually start working again, instead of acting like a survelliance cam and a distraction.,yes i know one of them irl. kek,Why do these normies want to see you so badly?Theyre NPCs, and Im not joking by typing that. Many of them cant  read  you without visuals, theyre unable to empathize though voice alone. Dont get me wrong, body language is very important, but were also not fucking dating here over Teams or whatever, its business.,finish lunchtime work outshower and have protein shakelog back in at 2pm with a stack of vinyls to listen to while I workplan to shut off the outside world of distractions and accomplish a months worth of work in 3 hours check Teams and see meetings from 2-4 where management will discuss action itemsmfw,npc,they all look retarded, strange. This is a thing now thanks to colleges accepting everybody these days. These are people just signaling because they eve have a job at  Tinder!  doing QA,This, i went from having literally 1 monthly meeting with my old boss, got a new boss after work from home, now have daily meetings were everyone just sits there and circle jerks about what they did and are going to do for the day like...why...,why is every single job 9-5 or around that time period? I fucking hate traffic more than anything in the world and it could end over fucking night if all the jobs werent all 9-5, not every job needs to be 9-5 anyway its all that way because everyone else did it that way. I would unironically request to work longer if it means no traffic, that way I can get paid at least and probably still only be home like 20-30 minutes later than usual because of the fucking traffic.That being said love working from home.,,So, before covid, and before i did work from home, and before the buy out we did this all happened at once. I legit had the most chad fucking boss of all time that understood the hatred of traffic, and the BS that is the 9-5 life My old in office life wasWake up at 430Go to the gym and lift from 5:30-6:30get to the office by 7Work until 11:30 or 12Take a 30-60 min lunch.Boss litearlly told me  Nah dude your lunch counts as your work, you are salaried.Work till 3 PMleaveskip traffic going inskip traffic going outWas the best times ever.,it really is insane when you think about it. for all this talk of muh environment muh global climate change, americans alone burn 9.1 millions of barrel a day on the daily nigger cattle commute.How much oil does the world consume? The United States consumes an average of 20.6 million barrels of oil a day. Forty percent of that — 9.1 million barrels — is used to power motor vehicles. https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/pipeline-us-and-global-oil-consumption/,I use to work from 6a to 2:30p, I loved itZero traffic during those times. Get off plenty early for doctors appointments, never had to take time off for things like that. Got to watch the sunrise with my coffee every day.,what time did you go to sleep each night anon?,This, off hours work is amazing. like just a 1 hour window off from the 9-5 is amazing.,Digits wasted. What a faggot you are.,why is every single job 9-5 or around that time period?World-wide synergy. Since those are designated work hours most businesses can interact with each other in flow rather than playing footsie tootsie around the inconvenient hours. Plus, the stronger the corporate vibes in the air outside your office windows, the more energized you will be to work.PNK IS THE MOST UNDERVALUED PROJECT IN THE ENTIRE CRYPTO SPACE DECENTRALIZED ARBITRATION IS NOT A MEME, IT IS NEEDED.

Oldfag here, I sort of use it to guage sentiment. Occasionally a news article that fell through the cracks surfaces here as well. 99% of the people here are in fact basement dwelling betas larping as millionaires.,What exactly were you expecting, OP? Its a message board entirely dedicated to hyping/pumping coins. At its most basic level, how does every pyramid scheme stay alive? Its totally dependent on new people joining in at a later time. Now multiply that by thousands of different cryptos, and you have thread after thread trying to get more people into the pyramid so they can continue to profit. And once the base of the pyramid starts to erode, they start to panic and will make even more threads.,Please dont come back thanks,Gauge*,Oldfag here, you are completely correct,I got some interesting info. If you go up to the Crosshouse viaduct, you will find there are plenty of newts underneath the rocks there.,,The only cryptocurrencies that have a future are ones that belong to networks that can have Decentralized Applications built on them.

Its called /biz Believe it or not but theres big boys who browse here who own actual stock in actual companies that provide actual value.

Just call him a nigger and abandon the thread.,fuck off nigger,Fuck reddit and fuck you nigger. I like this place but the longer I look at it the more I realize this place is literally the birthplace of the  dead internet theory.

Pretty sure you are but youre very annoying,Lurk moar,checked and nigger,Pretty much. Only the bitcoin maxis and ETH guys have stacks. I would guess most of those people are similar to me. Im about 90% bitcoin and my crypto net worth is around 110k. Im sure there are link millionaries and other alt coins but most are in the minority because they swing and always  waiting for alt season  or trying to time the market. After a few years they always get crushed. Im curious what happens with eth this time but Im not very hopefully for it. If anything seems like its getting worse. Most projects are leaving eth for other layer 1s and a lot of competition is heating up. I only hold it as a hedge like all my other alts.,kworthless opinion discarded.,I think theyre playing with like 20 and 50 dollar stacks.. straight brokes. The kind of dead beats that will lose their shit and do anything for a quick 1 dollar sell,most are bitter retards who put all their faith in a ponzi scheme so they dont put a bullet through their heads instead. Thats why most threads reek of crypto desperation. There is very little legitimate financial advice to be gathered here.,Do any of you have information worth sharing or is this board just a bunch of basement dwelling betas with nothing better to do than larp as billionaires?Good money requires fungibility. The only coin with proper fungibility is Monero.,Yeah, a self proclaimed newfag is telling everyone how shit runs around here. It is a crypto board. More specifically, it is a get rich quick delusion board. Crypto has just been the thing for the last decade, therefore making it a crypto board.,You should have been here 2017-2018.

A few of the posters here has held a higher up position or have experience from business management. Most crypto investors are very young and therefore they cant separate partnerships and customers.

There is a disconnect between people talking about how large their stacks are that would cost thousands upon thousands and then other threads where people talk about what they do for a living and there is no way they have the disposable income to accumulate that even over a few years.A NEET is basically someone who checked out of life but to survive they need to be a parasite on someone else (parents most likely). I dont think their parents are gifting them thousands a month to throw into magic internet coins, especially shit coins that have a 1/1000 chance of profit before being dumped on. If they are using  past profits  then why are they still mooching off their much more poor parents rather than being independent at that point? The larping logic breaks down.,This post is quite the throwback,Another LARP breakdown is when people are like. Im 21 with no job skills and 300k in savings but I cant afford a 450k house in my neighborhood because of inflation.Like what? Do you even fucking know how a mortgage works? You only need a downpayment of 5-10% and your claim of having enough savings to pay for 75% of the house outright yet you cant afford it so will continue to be a parasite or live in some shit apartment in the ghetto? My filters tell me everything they are saying is true except for the having savings part and having done any research ever into purchasing a property.,Doesnt know how to quote properlyFound the actual newfag,I dont even own any crypto and ive been here for more than a year.

Because its all a scam,Ask a financial advisor. You can find one pretty easy at a place like Edward Jones who only charges you on a % of what your investments make. Dont ask a board of 80% bots/shills/liars/trolls., post by this idokay,WTF is BMI?

I should charge larping fags who probably have no idea what inspect element even is to doctor their screenshots for them. Extra for the jeets who want accurate looking pump graphs and timestamps on brown/to white hands.

We snibbin,we will be 48k$ by EoW,I wish to fuck faggots would stop pretending they had any clue what will happen to the market. All we can do is hope our investments work out.

A paper wallet would be the safest option if youre worried about security.,No... You.. what??Are you actually retarded? One has unlimited exponential inflation the other is deflationary.

See how this works?,dont shorta-anon.... I....,!) Bitcoin has crashed with other markets due to it being a young asset class. Bitcoin has already started to bring down its correlation to the stock market but assets typically have some degree of correlation regardless. 2) You can sell BTC for other currencies and the value of USD against BTC will still be proportional so if the USD is worthless but you want USD you will just get a lot more of them.

Thats why you hear people saying  all you have to do is have a degree and not be retarded to earn 100k+ a year  etc. Some people get lucky, some get fucked. Doing everything correctly only gets you so far. Also the booming job market is a 100% manufactured meme and only extends to low level wagie positions that dont pay a living wage, like waitresses etc.t. master of science with honors and no job,imagine getting a masters when some currynigger with a 300$ degree will steal your job anyway.On the bright side, since youre unemployed and will likely be working for minimum wage, you will never have to pay those student loans.,Pythonkek,If I can get through the automated job application process, I would.I already have a job as a research assistant at a university.

OPs problem is probably that he doesnt have enough of the  experience  meme to qualify for positions that need it, while still touting an education level that signals that he wants that position/salary tier anyway.

Full of copium.,how big of a dompa for BTC are we talking?Below the general $30k level.Link will simply follow BTC down like a demented lapdog.,how do you know they have buy orders that big there?,supply is held by 100 walletsWhere can you see that?,Anon, over 60% of the total supply is still held by Sergey.Any metric for  muh top X holds Y amount of tokens  is going to be retardedly skewed.,https://insights.glassnode.com/an-on-chain-distribution-analysis-of-chainlink-link/Ok sorry im retarded,Well be sub 10 this week. Someone needs to get the team on record talking about what the fuck is going on. My ass they can’t talk about the price that’s all BS,I already know whats gonna happen ;),Dude don’t do it. This time it’s fucked wait for the 50% retrace it’s essentially guaranteed at this point.,I made it up, but it’s still true.,We all know what the fuck has been going on.Its not like it was subtle.,Lmao,Haha many people will get fucked by this. If you think all of a sudden people will buy at 15 again after the last month of shut you’re fucking wrong. Sub by end of week, single digits for smart con. Pump will take us to $11-12 that’s it. Max.,Yes these are Sergeys wallets. They are going to be distributed.,A low price also hurts the node operators, so Sergey either has buy back Link to save the price or increase his weekly dumps.,imagine not having sold at 150k satsimagine having your 4 year old shitcoin outperformed by a week old chink memecoinimagine seeing $1m link bags being posted everywhere and not realizing that was the topimagine being a link cultist,DR;NS,What would it take for another project to cause as much impotent seethe as chainlink does? Chainlink may be ahead in the oracle race as far as integrations go, but it is completely uncontested in the “causes people to rage” race by an absolute mile.,Do you seriously not know how to use etherscan?,Dont think its even possible to cause this much seethe in so many different parties: MEV-mafia, Bulgarian trannies and all the faggots who fell for the fud.,this, fud is soo pathetically weak now a days.ARBITRUM will use LINK for payments,okay bulgarian, you probably were saying the same shit when link went to 7muh sub-5 dollar link incomingor the same shit when we went to 1.5hahahah stupid linkies, you thought your coin wouldld stay over $1? back to $0.10 you go linktardsim not declaring it facts of what will or wont happen, im simply saying that in the past you bearfags call for lows beyond 70-80% and it just hasnt happened for stinky,It also bottomed out at 50,000 sats exactly on the same way, was very strange.,same day*,There wont be a smartcon pump as its increasingly looking like theyve got nothing to show again. So well dump like last time but without the prior pump so likely single digits. Nonetheless i believe in the project and Ive had a projected price estimate i made in late 19 that has yet to be wrong that predicts a $50-80 link EOY 2021, which is really just a bull run resumes price.,. The general public doesnt realize how much of an easy win Chainlink is. Its literally like winning the lottery in slow motion:The utility token with the most actual use cases and adoption (hundreds of integrations, grows by at least a dozen each week)Blockchain agnostic, so no matter which chain dominates, they will rely on ChainlinkPowers and secures pretty much all of DeFiTheir Price Feeds solution has a flawless track record of never being exploited. So if youre a DeFi protocol and you use Chainlink Price Feeds, its pretty much guaranteed youll never get flash loan attacked, or have an oracle exploit performed,how much of an easy win Chainlink is.h-haha yeah, easy...,There wont be a smartcon pump as its increasingly looking like theyve got nothing to show again. So well dump like last time but without the prior pump so likely single digits.This.,You’re a retard,I cant believe people as stupid as this exist. Holy shit. How old are you?,Im not fudding but anyone can see the speaker list and its basically all the same faces as last time with an even more defi weighting. They still have more to announce who could be big but my hopes there lowered when they sent an email announcing new speakers and when i checked it was people theyd announced weeks before lmao.Im still 99% in link, still believe well be at ATH end of this year, but I am genuinely disappointed by the teams output and i think the price reflects that being a general market sentiment. I dont think /biz/s fervour is enough to push it anymore.,Youre right about everything; but the Link price mostly reflects massive artificial suppression.,,I think there probably is manipulation from a few parties, MEV, binance, bots etc. But Ive never been convinced by the idea of wielding bitcoin in order to affect link given their respective marketcaps.,Ive never been convinced by the idea of wielding bitcoin in order to affect link given their respective marketcaps.Its not about marketcap, its about volume.And Link overtook Bitcoin in volume last summer. I dont know if ETH ever did that.Also, if youre not convinced by all this overwhelming proof, theres no helping you., out of 200+ speakers announced. The sad thing is that nothing of substance happened since last smartcon. We did not have a defi summer 2.0 etc.Why do you think we will get to ath this year again? There is not buying pressure anymore look at the volume.,strong support at 0.01 USDT based on that chart,Sergey dumping is the worst factor.Link hit its high vs ETH 2 weeks after sergey started upping his dumps from biweekly 500k dumps to weekly 500k dumps.Should have been a clear indication that the market couldnt handle 500k per week.Instead of realizing that he upped it to 1 million and then to 1.5 million.Link has unironically never had an upmove against ETH since and has done nothing but bleed.Why do you say hes dumping 2 mil?I can believe that the retard is contemplating to increase it to 2 mil yes.,Sergey dumping is the worst factor.lol no.His weekly dumps have been something like 0.25% of weekly volume.,UptrendDiagonal with two touchesNever change linkies,usage has plummeted.Holy shit youre retarded.Usage has never been this high.,network not needed, those are all scams,Then why does Swift have Defi on its radar?,central banking is also a scam,You will never be a woman.,peer-to-peer finance is a scamcentralized finance is a scamSo whats left?,nothing,everything is a scamtake THAT, ChainlinkYou are mentally ill.,chainlink is literally and unironically a complete scam,everything is a scamtake THAT, Chainlink,The last smartcon was also a nothingburger with maybe 100 views per video. Sad reality,The problem is the team just caters to the market. They make oracle software, they are not data providers themselves. So far in crypto people only care about defi so thats where Sergey focuses on for now,But it would still be about marketcap, volume is an irrelevant measure without that.,My estimate is just based on my rough chart that hasnt been off for 2 years and i dont think the wider bull run is over. When link was $40-50 people were calling me an fudder for saying maximally $80 eoy and now some say im coping saying minimally $50. As for the speakers i did say there were more to come but were close to the date and as said the promotional new speaker email was laughable. Its also really not like the team to hold back huge announcements like better speakers. I think the 100 remaining are going to be people in the networking streams and such.,I dont know man,I put it on a graph for you.Looks to me we cant handle anything beyond 500k/week.,Forgot pic,I  seriously dont ,Yeah, just ignore the whole market and Bitcoin completely. Retard. Anyway, LINK is dead, no matter what,muh $15 bottom It means absolutely nothing, were going below $15 this week.,Every fuckin thread about X crypto on this board assumes theirs is the bestIts fucking hilarious, take a look at every single chart for the main crypto currencies and see if you can spot any differences at all,I have seen the white paper.

Ill pass,Okay, sorry. I take that back. Didnt realize it was against ETH.Anyway, my point still stands. LINK is dead and will never get back to its former ATH against ETHNot even FUD. ETH gonna be deflationary soonLINK inflationary with weekly dumpsAnons who were in since 2018 and dint sell this obvious top last year can not be helped everAnd I am not even memeing. Nothing came out of this shit so far, apart from a few shitty integrations.Only hope is ISO20022 that will go live EOY 2022. But who knows if LINK will play a real role in this, or if it really was just another meme talk and bullshit.Anyway, I think a lot of anons who are still holding are in for a rough time and if they ever make it with LINK (assuming they have not) then it will take way way longer than most thought.Good luck faggots,Jesus fuck.

I said Link dumped that much because in 2017 it was just a useless coin.,And I am replying to youBut you missed the entire point of the discussion.I said Link dumped that much because in 2017 it was just a useless coin.Then why did it dump harder than any other top coin in 2021, despite powering most of Defi by now and being in talks with Swift?,Adding new supply to the market is a lot different then people trading the same LINK back and forth. Sergeys dumping does way more damage.,Nice headcanon.,BTW I have a very small bag of LINK but I am bullish and will be adding more. This project is strong, but you need a long term outlook (and trust in Sergey). Its like Amazon in the early 2000s running at a loss while it is gaining market share.

Would you like further assistance ESL-kun?market.link comes from linkpool, which is practically a 2nd party dev for Chainlink.

This card is pretty clear depiction of anguish, heartbreak and sorrow. Youve probably had a rough time in the recent past like a lot of us here have. The emperor in the present is all about discipline. Hes the boss of the zodiac. Rams on his chair, golden looped cross in his right hand, wearing armor and an ornate crown. This is King energy. The knight of wands in the future is all about movement and momentum with action. The chariot at the bottom represents movement, momentum and urgency.Do you feel like time is running out? Do you have a hard time taking action and being disciplined? Overcome these obstacles and build momentum in the direction of your choosing! The portal is open for all of us to begin building and creating. Dont wait for the right time or after xrp moons. Get things in order so you can seize opportunities.,Will I finally die anytime soon?Thanks in advance.,What about the pools? As long as XRP is in dip there is a good chance to invest some more. Farmhero platform has been running on polygon networks for quite some time now, once XRP pools are available there, I think it will be really profitable at this point,In fact, HONOR continues to be a pretty good investment at this point. farmhero continues to evolve and the coin will grow further,Pls do me, oh great tarot schizo.How is my life post xrp moon. I would like to find a girl and live the life. Currently virgin in a rut.,Situation: four of swordsChallenge: nine of cupsBottom: five of swordsMaybe the death you seek is ego death... Ego and vanity block one from peace and tranquility. Maybe a need to prove yourself is creating a blockage from true rest and contentment within. If stress relief has been on your mind do meditation. Are you being deceitful or sneaky in some way? Or are you being deceived in some form? Keep an eye out.,accurate I guess. Im gonna try to meditate. I have been somewhat deceitful lately trying to get a 10/10 trad gf. Unsuccessfully though,All this casual divination here is unsettling. Hell be waiting with open arms when you decide to stop screwing around.,Make new friends, but keep the old.One is silver, the other is gold.XRP will be matched to the price of gold. But what will match the price of silver?,,Card: two of Pentacles Bottom: seven of wandsYoull never find a partner if youre combative and look at them like an enemy. A successful relationship is a team, a man leads and a woman nurtures. Its hard to find quality partners these days. The two of Pentacles is juggling two things, focus on your life and open room to attract a partner.,Christ is King anon. Tarot is a tool, its symbolic art. Pic related is a good read.,I just want to take the opportunity interact with Tarot anon on this special bake during the potential home stretch of our long odyssey. I wanted to ask something broader that would be of interest to all of the excellent anons who make the magic happen, like what will the be fortune of core xsg anons/ hodlrs but that might be way too vague.If so, and if the divinator is still warmed up and you feel like looking, what do the cards say for xrp price from 2 years onward? Please choose what you consider the better inquiry. If this question is dog shit wrapped in cat shit, please feel free to ignore.,Based. Farmhero introduced almost the first polygon network for farming pools. This is one of the reasons why honor has grown so actively to $1,Ty tarotanon,You are on the right path. Trust yourself. I see you were at a crossroads. You made a decision that required you to be cautious for stabilities sake? Things are moving fast. Maybe you caught feelings for the girl quickly. Union is indicated here. Ill repeat trust yourself while walking your path and youll end up exactly where you need to.,Checked,No. If you want to be happy find ways to give back and make others happy. Dont fill from an empty cup though.,Hahahaha, very interesting, its like all of us know and have always known. Thanks for this friend.,Thanks tarotanon. I need to trust my gut,Should i buy the land tarot-anon?,Situation: knight of wandsChallenge: seven of wandsPast: nine of pentaclesFuture: five of pentaclesAs above: temperanceAs below: ace of cupsYou: the devilEnvironment: high priestessGuidance: page of pentaclesOutcome: five of cupsI see you desire change in your situation. Is fear of rejection or fear of failure holding you back? Have you recognized that you were in your comfort zone (nine of Pentacles). The five of Pentacles indicates the struggle of self improvement. Even though the two people who are injured are walking cold in the snow, there is the glass art in the church to give them hope. Faith and higher vision gets us through the daily struggle. The temperance and ace of cups polarity is really beautiful. It tells me there is angelic influence in your life aiding you. The devil card is all about the habits that bind us. What chains do you need to break? The high priestess shows there are synchronicities all around you. Notice the signs. As guidance the page of Pentacles urges you to start the path towards prosperity. A great journey begins with a single step. Five of cups as the outcome may look grim but I dont think so. The man has spilled three cups but two remain behind him. There is a mess to clean up but there is still something to cherish and keep safe. Focus on positivity and solutions to clean up that mess anon!,Tarotanon, since youre still around, can do you do mine? Health, wealth, love, happiness, all aspects welcomed.,Forgot pic again F,Youll be the last one I get to tonight. Thanks for all the kind words frens.,I wasnt able to sleep, so I checked bread and you were still around. Perhaps meant to be. Thank you fren :),The standard!,Thank you for asking this and Im glad you did. I chose the former as personally Im not interested in the price action of XRP but in the spiritual aspects of everything unfolding. Present: five of swords (conflict, winning at all cost, competition) Challenge: the star (purpose, spirituality, faith) Past: death (change and transformation) Future: ace of wands (new beginnings) As above: the hermit (solitude, soul seeking) As below: three of wands (expansion, purposeful thinking, planning) Us: nine of wands (healing from trauma) Environment: five of cups (dark winter) Guidance: six of cups (community, inner child, happiness, love) Outcome: knight of wands (energy, passion, purposeful action)Bottom: six of Pentacles (giving back, charity) The nature of 4chan is chaotic and full of vile things. People from all over the world plus robots say whatever they want. Then you have the janny problem. We are all anonymous. Deceit, banter, roasting, doxxing, happenings, all are commonplace here. Especially in these threads theres constant fudders and shills. That helps us discern. Our challenge is to evolve our consciousness. This is a powerful community. There is a lot of wisdom here + in the xsg archive. If what we say comes to pass then we will have major influence over the world at least for a brief time. It will be what we make it. Things will get darker because the cabal is fighting to the death but their last breathes are close. So prepare for things to get worse but hope for the best. Dont delay your life for the great reset. We only have today and this moment and each choice leads to the next. Break the loop youre in and spiral upwards. We can build a great community together that makes the world a better place or let it fall into the hands of those who would do us harm. If you are an xrp schizo you are a visionary. Put that talent to use in your unique way! We all need to support each other. Thats the only way were all going to make it.,Past: high priestessPresent: king of wandsFuture: queen of wandsBottom: the devilWhats interesting here is the duality in the devil card, high priestess and the royal pair. If you dont have a partner already I see you crossing paths with someone. It will be a strong connection. You have learned a lot and have had much insight. Now you are going forth and putting it into practice. Beware the bad habits and vices.,,Whats on the cards for me in general, anon?,Bless you anons.

Im sure Im not alone in my appreciation.,2 WEEKS!,should i go ahead an finish this business plan?,you sonofabitch,Hey! I remember you; Youre the anon with downs syndrome that likes to post pictures of cartoons for infants. To be perfectly honest with you, I never really cared for this whole man child thing, but to each their own (thats my motto). But to get back to your comment, it might not be realistic to think that ETH 2 is coming out anytime soon. Definitely not 2 weeks. Its unfortunately going to stay broken and shitty for a long time and those EIP miner forks or whatever will probably just fuck things up worse. Not to be a downer and I really do hope you can keep trading pump and dump scam trash. At least you can use the Binance chain for the time being. Okay. See you around, dont come back. Adios.,guys my mommy said coinbase is going to relist xrp soon and she said she heard it on the internetis it finally happening did I finally get insider information,My great aunt recently passed away and I inherited a huge crystal ball that she had purchased from a Romanian gypsy lady in France. I read your comment and felt a little bummed out that your question was going to miss Tarot Anons narrow divination window. I thought to myself that it might be a good idea to smash the ball on to the floor of my skank basement with all the force I have in hopes of finding an answer to your question. Hope this helps:The crystal broke into three pieces, each with a different quasi holographic image inside. On the first shard is an image of a fish made out of pimento baloney. On the second shard is a mountain made of ears. And on the final shard is a finished business plan.,Think you got the wrong goy Rand,Guys... I hate the anti-christ.

The answer to this is obviously no. You had a long nightmare anon. Now you are back awake and everything is bueno beyond belief. Lets re-cap: youve got a blockchain innovation act making its way through the Legislative Branches so to cut of the digital Yuan and Facebooks Libra, youve got a deadline of the 28th or 29th for the SEC to have clarity on crypto, youve got the Sunshine Act Meeting, and youve got Hinnman by the balls to talk about all sorts of whys and whens. The reality is that no one knows. You want Coinbase to re-list? Okay. Great. Maybe something will happen, maybe its a long slog to Valhalla. I guess well just wait and see where the ride goes. I think we are all going to make it. Good luck.,Secret Confession Time:I dont like cartoons, but I do have a very unique form of Downs Syndrome.

Then run the entire thing offline on your own computer.64^5 is brute forceable although its going to take a laong time (speed up if you kind of recognise some characters anyway). How much is stored on there?,You are a complete tool and an idiot.Brute-forcing 5 missing characters is this simple: If you cant piece it together given that information, then you deserve to lose it all.

For some reason the ceo thinks sitting in your chair = more work no matter what.I fucking hate this shit. I did more work from home than I ever did at the office. Constantly being distracted by people. I cant watch my dog run in the backyard while I code.I will wait until the company vests and then I am going to quit and find a remote job,getting dragged back into the office on a 2 days in the wage cage, 3 days at homei bet this will go from 2 days, to 5, to 6 or something silly like that,Hey guys, I know I am seeing a lot of back-and-forth on this topic, but I really need to push back and raise some red flags here. Having an on-site office presence foundational to our ability to drive efficiencies in a corporate landscape. It is in our DNA. Sure, there is no one size fits all or silver bullet and some are just boilerplate solutions, leveraged to the hilt and really only keeping us at a 30,000-foot-view of things. Being on-site, however, really allow us to get better granularity, find better directional-indicators, or loop back and dive deep into some critical issues on a go-forward basis.I think if you all start spending more time in the office gain, youll find yourself trending toward the positive, but youll have to keep an eye on the puck. Gut through it, reduce thrash, and lets stay in lock-step on this. Yes, we will synergize!Whats the root cause of the hatred of Corporate office spaces? Ill put my laymans hat on and guess that it comes from movies such as Office Space and Dilbert cartoons. But we all know that these are fictional spaces, and real office spaces allow us to touch base in a much more efficient manner.I have to time-box this comment, as I have a hard-stop in a moment when I will have to jump onto a call. So, just one more point that I want to cover-off on: lets socialize the idea of having more office presence and loop back to see whether were being more impactful. From a management standpoint, I think that we can get the traction to do it.So, net/net, ignore the naysayers, sidebar the folks that are stuck in the weeds, and dont waste cycles or bandwidth on folks that dont align strongly with this mission. Try it out, and well have another touch point in a little while to see if weve moved the needle. Remember, our north star hasnt changed.

That said, how much should I worry about them starting to monitor us and make sure were at least staying out of Away status on Teams, etc.? My job is generally busy but I also dont need anyone breathing down my neck when the stars align and I get to relax because every project is in a holding pattern.,Bruh its so easy to fake the online status just do that and you wont get any complaints, remember, never, EVER, give them access or let them monitor your personal devices,I dont want to go back lads.

More money to spend on consooming as opposed to housing = more people consooming kitchen appliances / clothes / TVs etc4. Less demand on transport system = fewer bus tickets / less fuel purchased / less cars bought (this last one also has the double accelerator because online shopping has now been pushed ahead even further during the plandemic)5.

That being said I’m getting awfully close to selling already. I want to keep some of my gains.,i got in at $10 expecting it to go to 4K,Just hold? Why sell for a loss? Not like you retards are playing options. 99% of meme stonk trsders are playing SHARES.,,This implies that the stock has a potential upside, which of course it does but it is fundamentally overvalued. I know the play isn’t based on fundamentals, but if you don’t believe in the play any more then your only option is to sell at a loss or risk losing even more.,(((They))) have PhDs in psychology creating FUD, no where else is falling for this shit except biz,Just like “no one” is selling.

You didn’t see the “mistype” 4 shares bought for 20k yesterday??,Imagine believing the Jew scroller.,So in case anyone forgot, it seems highly unlikely that the price will rise today by very much, if at all.Id wager that there will be a relatively large dip, and that the price wont start increasing until next week at earliest.I wouldnt try swinging this shit though because gme is unpredictable as fuck and I know fuck all about stocks.,where was this?,Kek illiterate baggies,real price is over 3Ksauce?,Use the correct thread pasta you fuck,Literally go klog up another thread niggers, I’m tryna discuss what type of car me and the boys are gonna buy when this shit hits $300-$1k,Imagine holding bags at 300 per share since january and taunting a general full of anons with anywhere between 200-800% gains even during this dipmaybe in a few months we will so who was the illiterate baggie all along,we will know*,AHahaha retard thinks amc will ever reach 1k. stupid fuck,How much do you get paid for shilling amc?,Yikes!

Why would they spread fud that were going up? I get its for everyone to sell at 100 but this gives everyone a comfort that no matter how red the daysnow we are for sure going back up to at least 100.,second image to go along with my comment,tl;dr?,this is a reverse false-flag by AMC redditors trying to make it look like theyre being shilled isnt it,Semite located. We are over the target. I repeat we are over the target,Re affirming what we know dark pool shenanigans more calls than puts market manipulation Also Citadel literally has a meeting rooms full of psychological PHDs drawing up psy op plans,They’re also long on amc, learn to read.,go check the lou versus wallstreet videos for yourself. Him aside, I saw it those bots for myself back when we were at 14 before the first jump and now theyre starting to pop up,102 shares sincd jan and not selling btw,im whitei will actually, if people are being paid to shill, surely they arent that fucking obvious kek,Go check the youtuuubesState of the illiteracy general.,Sold some shares yesterday to get some profit but Im still up by a lot, would be great if it did go to 3k.,Actually a pussy and retarded,Those bots arent organic you retard and Im not claiming theyre due dilligence but someone for some reason is posting them and in my experience we jumped from 14 to 72 when I saw them the last time. Im literally asking for what I asked before: for what purpose are they doing this?,Like unironically explain to me why you would sell right now. What? Number go down? Oh fucking no. Boo hoo. We’re still at $40 you fucking retard. We were at 5$ only a few weeks ago. Number goes down before it goes up buddy. Look at the fucking graph. We’re in the 2nd big dip before the 3rd take off,Febuary is not a few weeks ago.,damn, I never hated hedgies for shorting GME.But this is where they fucking made me really hate them.This shit has been in massive decline for 2 weeks now with no stabilization.,End of may was the first jump from 14 so he is reight that it was a few weeks ago. We crabbed from January to almost june from 4 to 15,OY VEY SORRY MR SHECKELSTIEN, 8-11$ A FEW WEEKS AGO. OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,FUCK BOBOs IM A BULL NOW,Based,Why do you guys think this will go up? Not trolling, just asking what any DD suggests this has a chance of making it? GME has tons, but all I ever see of AMC holders is just  meme stock/diamond hands,  no real actual reasons. Its not like you guys have 200%+ SI like GME has. Asking because it would be nice to buy some for tons of shares and easy gains, but wtf is the rationale here.,Here ya go.,They can’t read and a youtuber told them it was the same as gme.,Well your posts have just made my withdrawal so much sweeter. I might even sell some more!,what am i looking at and why should i believe it?,GME DD basically applies to AMC as well, unlike GME, AMC is also a reopening play - both are dying businesses and people just want to make money and/or fuck over Talmud magicians.,Conspiracy theoriesEvery movement that isn’t in your favor is manipulation Every news that gets reported about anything is directly related to AMC Every single action taken by any financial institution is also directly related to AMC Any dissenting opinion is made by a Semitic shill bot rocket emojis diamond hand emojis ape emoji That’s all the DD you need fren,Okay,Hurry up and bounce back you bastard,Its so weird that instead of enjoying your life youre in here trying to troll.Like dont you have a hobby or a job?,Patience dude,You are looking at an error but the AMC community is now surpassed /pol/ in tin foil hat schizo power level.,I’m not trolling. I hold AMC, but the community is absolutely batshit fucking delusional and crazy. I understand why, but it’s gotten out of hand real fast.,Schizos always win. It’s why we all hold XRP and AMC,So basically, everyone admits there isnt really a reason but figure since there are shorts here that enough retail pressure can make something happen anyways? Its retarded, but at least kind of makes sense. However it sure as shit surely aint going to millions,I just hate how close the type was to Lous claims of 5000+         hidden second books price       because its going to embolden that schizo so fucking much and all the people that talk about him will slurp his nuts even harder.,I’m really not trying to spread fud in you guys little club but you’re being rugpulled. Cramer basically told you all to keep holding so his hedge fund friends could extract max profit from their long positions. So that they can survive gme a little bit longer. If this tweet wasn’t the most obvious sell signal I don’t know what’s gonna get you guys to finally figure it out.,but the community is absolutely batshit fucking delusional and crazythis is whats keeping me from pulling the trigger on clov. if they were as retarded as the amc community i would of bought in already.,The shills are quick to jump on it. Denial is the first step in realizing your semitism,i unironically hold a fat stacks of xrp, gme, one and amc among other things,Lou is a grifter but he knows. He wasn’t the first person in the world to suggest Jews manipulated the scroller so much that they just put down whatever numbers they wanted. It’s been known for a long time. He just struck amc while it was hot,When it hit 70 I made the conscious decision to not sell and gamble it going higher. If it crashes completely then fine, I already made my decision. I’ll hold it until it hits 100 or before I get a loss at 14.,Exactly my thinking, but my sell numbers are $120, $300, and $500 depending on momentum,everyone who says anything that contradicts your narrative is a shill. Honestly you guys are just making this real unfriendly for new investors which we desperately need.,You’re looking at the actual price that got past the Jew filter. 4 shares at $5k. They have been doubling down on the FUD and shorting even more since the launch a few months ago. The price will sky rocket if the nakeds are revealed and they have to buy back every single one of them. All it takes is for them to get raided (probably won’t happen) or have a whistleblower come out (most likely scenario). They’ve already have people on the inside releasing actual short positions etc months ago. Keep your eyes open because there are going to be a lot more crumb drops like this.,One could make an equally baseless claim that hes being a sarcastic prick trying to make fun of the language of the commoner investing in AMC. Speculation is all good until it isnt.,Floor is $5k. If you sell before then you deserve to be poor for the rest of your life,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/you-could-lose-everything-on-meme-stocks-franklin-templeton-ceo-135011534.htmlIts over baggies,You’re the one with the FUD and the demoralization.

Please keep some semblance,Kek,chad posteris in reality noodle wristsThe contradiction here is astounding. Show nose I’m curious,According to my TA $48 EOD is locked,That’s exactly what he was doing, it’s obvious for anyone with two brain cells left. FUDYou see, you can’t just call anything that goes against the cult dogma FUD and demoralization. Facts are neutral, I’m speaking facts.,Because the real point of getting people into AMC, which had a lot of shorting, but no where near as much as gamestop, was to get people away from investing in the real short squeeze.,Regarding fintel price. We can tell its a clerical error, but we cant verify if its one that let a true price slip or put in too many digits. Only time will tell., speaking factsNo you’re a parrot for the Jew media and banks. You only reiterate what you’ve heard come from an institution. If that’s the case you don’t need to be in AMC. AMC is organic and is ran by individuals collectively. You are on the side big biz, media, banks, pharma etc. unless numbers or information comes from them you won’t believe it. You need to rethink your life choices and do some digging on your own.,Why even make the generals anymore? Lol. and just like that AMC will never be over $36 again,Not the only actual price screen shot out there. IYKYK,AMCniggers finally getting ruggedfeels good desu. no use those 2 reining brain cells you have and put whatever gmyou could save from your last welfare check into GME,Holy fuck you are so far gone it’s unbelievable. How many shares are you holding at what price? In the interest of honesty I have 340 @ 9,Lmfao Cramer did a number on you niggers. Couldnt imagine bagholding this compared to GME right now kek.Still time to load up on the real squeeze.,https://youtu.be/hHulBXMtro8We are over the target,Wish I never got rid of my shorts.,Sure. And dude, never said I would sell immediately at those numbers, just being cauti,another -10% in a single hour,feeling outrageously antisemitic today,is this finally the crash before it spikes up?ive been waiting for this for the past month and im still waiting to buy,Bobro, you would have made big bank not gonna lie here.,Why don’t we just storm the funds with rifles and force them to buy their shorts now,Why cant they just keep it up with the fake price forever, though - will we ever be able to sell at the real price? If not it doesnt really matter even if youre right,Literally no floor. But Trey et all will call this “healthy consolidation”,Would this be a good time to acooomulate?,Thats what I get for swinging.,Citadels bailout wasnt near enough money to cover their shortsSimple as,Unironically,WERE CRASHING THIS STOCK WITH NO SURVIVORS,I just realized something. In a way weve backed ourselves into a corner as much as we have the hedge funds. If this whole thing fails for us, theyre going to do everything in their power to absolutely ream the assholes of the retail investors for daring to attempt such a thing. At this point, the squeeze has to happen, weve gone too far already.,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,Hello there my fellow apes!The squeeze has started!The new floor is now $100We need to stop being greedy.,Great idea, no way that could possibly backfire on us.,AMC will never be over 36 ever again,buy the dip hodl diamond handsBuy the dip pleaseSirs buy dip plzMy bastards buy my bags plz sirSo this g28a0is how pajeets are made.Fascinating.

Did you turn bobo now?,Im pretty sure everyone with a single braincell is bobo atm,so many no-amcers in this thread today my fellow apes! diamond hands! remember we control the float and we set the price and we just have to put the price on the moon!,are there other people here posting lum?all i really am long on is 3x bull ETFs,Noob here. Can non americans take action against these retard jew hedge funds?They are kinda stealing peoples money by doing illegal shit.Just wondering because theres probably more non americans investing in these stocksa nd they are messing with our money.,It’s surprising to see people who called me a fudder yesterday turn while I’m still holding like a retard.,there was this european man in the late 1930s who tried to do something along with other things but it failed i think not sure,At some point someone is going to come collect what they are owed. This is distraction and demoralization to throw out the paper handed retailers. We OWN 100% of the float. It’s ours. We can HOLD forever and buy more as it dips during this time.,are there other people here posting lum?lum is the mascot of /smg/,who tried to do something along with other things,Look at this cultist post, see how they spread as much disinformation as the hedge funds? Faggot we only own 80% of the float, not 100%,noos theys doin the illegal fings and taking our monies its not fair ape bros we have to keep hodling,i know, im the one who brought her therei dont come to /amc/ much so i didnt know if she was posted here tooi dont mind thoughevery thread is a lum thread,So do you think price will really go to 4-5K? I have been thinking 100s for sure but on the fence about the giga pump up to 10k or whatever,Yea, I figured maybe some small payout or something can exist here. I am all-in on GME, but I got cash leftover so riding the AMC train for 4 shares. Why the fuck not, spend the rest of my money somewhere.,I imagine most people that posts in stock generals also post in /smg/ I have a bunch of lum saved on my computer and even posted a one earlier its likely there are several lum posters or at least plenty of people with her saved from smg,P-P-Papa Elon come save me. kek,why are you fudding my fellow ape 100k is fud i will not sell my AMC for less than 1m/share,The desperation is palpable. It’s embarrassing really.,Positive DD is being actively redacted,Aron said we own at least 80%At least is key word. All the while apes are not selling and only buying. It’s at 99.9% at this rate with how many fake shares we have absolutely gobbled. Keep it up with your kike banking media tho hope it works out,Remember that mid-30s was the real value of the stock for some time. Hedgies want to pressure it to 0, which is possible, apes want to push it to 1mil, which is also theoretically possible. The point is that, if you got in under 30 its comfy time now until something happens.,noooo the hedgies must be using their media influence too this isnt fair bros we have to keep going. They will learn.,BASED,looks like its bouncing back...,Bought another 10 today, discount days are comfy,amc will be worth 1 million a share in only two more weeks,.9%A large part of the remaining 20% is tied up in very big ETFs that cant be traded easily. Its actually comforting to know because I dont trust a lot of the people who fomod in,in all honesty im just posting the price predictions as a memei have no idea where this shit is going, the price action makes zero logical sense, its fun to watch though,The ribbitors are palpably insane,there was no thread, idk man i just made it,the fuck? errors  dont just happen like that.,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH,Theyre just dumping the price to shake out the bitches.

This will allow the elites to print even more money and accelerate the fiat collapse,Better question is why the fuck would they put down the people who actually GOT the vaccine? Wouldnt that be the more subservient group of people (ie the ones those in power would want to keep)? If they were planning on killing any group off why wouldnt they kill off the ones who are retaliating by not getting the vaccine? You anti-vaxxers have yet to answer this question.,Very few people are autistic about not getting the vaccine. Most of the vaccine hesitant people are normies that heard on a radio show that the vaccines are experimental, and therefore they should avoid them.,Pharmaceutical companies are greedy and want to profit off you your poor health. They are the soulless, and they lobby soulless governments that also just want profit. Thats it, theres no greater conspiracy or planning here.

Faggot.What is /CMMG/?Here we focus on the big picture Macro Economic outlook, the Commodities bull market, and how we can profit from it with the right Mining Equities and other commodity related investments like Physical Precious metals.What is the big picture Macro Economic outlook?Here we believe in Austrian (real) economics, not State propaganda delivered by public schools and universities, MSM, and central banks. Here are some of the core beliefs:(1) One of the keys to economic growth and prosperity is a high rate of personal savings and capital formation.(2) Free markets provide a higher standard of living for all.(3) High taxes and government regulations stifle economic activity.(4) Government inflationary policy is responsible for the boom-bust business cycle.If you want to learn more about Austrian Economics, here are some fantastic beginner booksWhat has government done to our money? - Murray Rothbardhttps://mises.org/library/what-has-government-done-our-moneyThe mystery of banking - Murray Rothbardhttps://mises.org/library/mystery-bankingProfit   Loss - Ludwig Von Miseshttps://mises.org/library/profit-and-loss-0Relevant Information regarding Mining Equitieshttps://pastebin.pl/view/fddd4572Free download link to The Mining Valuation Handbookhttp://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=E2B086542296BC826D6F5C7E948D274Bhttps://kitco.com/https://mining.com/https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/https://undervaluedequity.com/https://tradingeconomics.com/Must Watch: What Commodities Have The Most Leverage For the Commodity Bull Market From Here?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRuE4pGVXSQ t Previous Thread,Youtube Channels for Mining   MacroPalisade Gold Radiohttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6X0ttmzTAJt_2ebcqcIbYwMining Stocks Educationhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Xnap-g3EZuddiUeauMlNQNewsSprott Moneyhttps://www.youtube.com/user/sprottmoneyltdGoldsilver pros (Rob Kientz)https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBUqGiXIR5fz83FtqRSOq3gFinding Value Financehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7REFmsnHu34TNLxLCGiEcQManeco64https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAvSnci_3qHF_7c2LQnP_wgPeter Schiffhttps://www.youtube.com/c/peterschiff/videosMacro Voiceshttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCICRehoZjq3ZtAWgRJX118A/videos,,Re: the opinions of Rick Rule, Don Durrett, GV, etc:We have access to most of the same information that these mining stock  experts  do. We dont go tour the mines or interview the management, but that is typically not needed for retail investors to succeed. There is CEO.CA, the investor presentation, drill reports, financial reports, management interviews, historic geological records, etc. that we all can freely access. Plus, we have each other in CMMG, and there are some extremely knowledgeable and informed anons in these threads who can assess mining companies. I can think of at least four of them right now, and Im sure there are many more. So we dont necessarily need a Rick Rules guidance or input with all of the knowledge, resources, and the community we have. Plus, we should always be wary of blindly trusting the experts, anyway. If we just followed what the experts said, we would be double-masked, fully-vaccinated, investing in bonds and mutual funds, eating disease-causing grains, driving unsafe electric vehicles, and smiling upon perverts as they corrupt our society. Forget listening to experts. Become an expert yourself. Or find a community of many people whose collective knowledge, resources, and experience rivals that of a singular expert.,Rick Rules guidanceRick isnt good for junior mining companies.

If anything I will pick up more shares for cheap. Thanks Krauts,/CMMG/ creator here. thanks to OP for carrying the torch and the great OC. Im just quickly stopping by to share a few things I hope youll find interesting. The first is an excerpt from an incredible book The Economics Of Inflation: A Study Of Currency Depreciation In Post-War Germany  This is the most comprehensive and authoritative account of the great German inflation from 1914 to 1923.  - Henry HazlittWhen Ive found the time, Ive been studying the conditions of the Weimar hyperinflation, because I see staggering similarities between the social and economic conditions of that time period and the society we live in now, and think that studying It will give us precious insights into our future. Here something fascinating Ive found: A chart from 1923, produced by the Statistical Bureau of the Reich, which shows the real (gold) value of fiat currencies around the world at the time (pic related) What Id love to do is create a contemporary version of this chart and overlay the two, so we can see the enormous collapse in value of fiat currencies across the world.If anyone is interested, you can get the book for free here; herehttps://mises.org/library/economics-inflation-study-currency-depreciation-post-war-germany,Democrats Strike Deal On $3.5 Trillion  Human Infrastructure  Packagehttps://www.zerohedge.com/political/democrats-strike-deal-35-trillion-human-infrastructure-packageWhen an empire and its currency dies, it has to print money endlessly with abandon in order to keep its entire economic system afloat. Hence why a Democrat regime was installed in the US. Democrats are the spenders. This installation needed to happen because, if Trump (a Republican) can been ordered by the regime to print endless amounts of money in the dying days of the dollar, the Republican-Democrat Overton Window of modern politics would have completely shattered and the entire country would wake up to the complete sham that is our governance. So an extremely popular Republican President had to be removed in order to install a print-and-spend puppet Democrat just because the end of the dollar was and is imminent. So if you think there should be riots and widespread distrust of government now, imagine what it would be like if Trump, and not Biden or another Democrat, was ordered to suddenly start sloshing around tens of trillions of dollars to keep the system on life support. It would have resulted in massive cognitive dissonance the world over and a complete breaking of the modern political system. Hundreds of millions of angry gun-owners who would have felt betrayed and lied to, and who would have realized that everything they knew and believed their whole life about politics and government was a lie. So Biden being installed despite overwhelming evidence that he had zero public support was done almost to protect the American people and keep the facade of political identity alive long enough to allow for a peaceful transfer of the balance of power and wealth to the east. Still remarkably evil, but the dynamics are interesting.,Just to clarify the math here, 1 gold mark, i believe, was equivalent to 358g pure gold, so simply convert each mark(358g) into oz to get modern figureseg; Australia 1922: 122.96 gold marks per inhabitant = (122.96 x 358g = 1.5527 gold/oz per inhabitant),Here are some excellent thoughts on Diversification for those of you who are concerned about wether you are overly or under diversified. this advice has proved invaluable to me over the years and allowed me to sleep easy.

Im not able to buy a lot of the individual stocks mentioned in these threads,GDXJ (gold mid-caps), SILJ (silver mid-caps).,Your pic related is very interesting. I agree with that statement. Unfortunately, it takes a lot of knowledge-building and research, as well as confidence, to build wealth with just a few positions. I think that CMMG as a whole is uniquely able to do this because of the strong and intelligent community weve built here. While we are open to discuss any and every commodity-related investment vehicle, you will notice that there are a few ETFs, mining equities, and stocks that we discuss frequently, and I would be bold enough to say that there is majority agreement among us that these frequently-discussed companies will be the ones that create a significant amount of wealth for their investors.,Can anyone give me any recommendations for trading platforms?,The more I informed I become the less hope I have for the masses.Im on this page.

Baru gold (which I remember @oldbanker liked and some people here brought up too) and Precipitate Gold. Baru has dumped all the way 0.21 to 0.7, seemingly from some kind of legal issues in Indonesia. And Precipitate Gold (which was a favourite Dave Kranzler stock) has just dumped another 10% on bad assays and is now all the way down from its high of 0.35 CAD to 0.09 CAD (-75%). These DR stocks keep getting cheaper and cheaper and increasingly tempting me.Seems that the share price isnt responding to it so far. When Galleon announced a  a new discovery at West Cache Gold Project  yesterday the share price didnt move either. I suppose that the market only tends to move on concrete assays.,gramms of pure goldwtfone gold mark is 1,79 gramms if gold,Tom is bullish = good!,Golden Ridge gonna make me rich,I think theres a plan for a post US monetary order coming into view.

There are so few microcap silver producers or near-term producers which wont look for a buyout, the failure of KS only makes the list even smaller.The longstanding insider buying continues at MTB. Wonder if the chart will some day resemble what happened to Azimut. I really need to get a better position there because its a good gamble.Fascinating newsBrazil didnt have much gold in the first place (only 67 tonnes), so another 41.8 tonnes is very significantPoland also wants to buy 100 tonnes of gold, and Hungary increased their holdings to 94.49 tonnesAnd of course Uzbekistan is now using gold as a currencyWe should start compiling these news articles, because the information falls out of mindIf Bayhorse and Blue Lagoon beat the odds and dont end up like the other failed microcap producers like BARU and KS, then I think that will only make them seem all the more remarkable and cause an even greater flood of people into them at this point,Because it has value. Digits by themselves do not and do not build trust between countries.,Why would i buy dips when the trend is clearly down?,Why would i buy dips when the trend is clearly down?because youre long term bullish?,Why back a digital currency by physical gold that’s held in the hands of a central bank that can lie about how much gold, or sell, or warIn a post-dollar world, in which one country (i.e. America) cant impose its currency on everybody else by force, you will need to have something of universal desirability to back your currency if you want other nations to take you seriously. The only way to have credibility for your currency will be gold reserves, gold-convertibility, and proper audits. Central banks would rather not be tied to gold. But theyll have no choice. And for every country but America, adopting gold and dumping the dollar will be an enormous benefit, since it will end commodity-suppression on the COMEX, and Americas outsourcing of inflation.Nobody can truly guess the bottom,From 1 January 1876 onwards, the mark became the only legal tender. The name Goldmark was created later to distinguish it from the Papiermark (paper mark) which suffered a serious loss of value through hyperinflation following World War I (see inflation in the Weimar Republic).

You cannot get it wrong with fundamentals.,All women are Nm2w4,You keep yourself for qtgoat, my kazakh friend.,Teens are,Can I please speak with the Asian baddie over the SYLO decentralized messaging app, I wouldnt want my trans frens see our chats so Ill keep it encrypted.,Copium overload,Ha! Without your Dp those APYs already gave you away, only PNODE has that much earning power now IMO tho. My highlight in the unifarm cohort is farming other coins while you just stake one, pretty profit huh!.,is this right? will this coin make me rich mr anon?or you just try to spam people with crapI have already joined ChihuaToken,at least khazakh women are somewhat  easy  to get.I just dont get it, why is it that these people are rewarded for investing in absolute vaporware while the actual smart investors who does their DD gets nowhere in terms of price changes,If you dont get it then you lack that  instinct , without this instinct you can educate yourself as much as you want but you will never get it, sorry anon,Shitcoins that pump for a week to astronomical amounts do not compare to top 10 coins that have been around for years.,Okay but its the only way to turn a small entry investment to a sizeable amount of fiat that can be put on these sound investments,I know this will come off as cope, but bear with me here:Im above average IQ. All indicators (academic career, income, language proficiency, actual IQ tests, etc.) point to this.I barely understand some of the more complex projects that I believe in and have invested in. Now, what do you think the average and below average IQ crowd does? You think they understand a single sentence of a whitepaper? Why certain services will actually become important for the Internet and/or the crypto economy in a few years? Why Eth killer A is probably better than Eth killer B?Of course not.But can they understand  FUNNY MEME, LINE GO TO THE MOON :DDD  shilled by their favorite e-celebs and Twitter shills? Of course they can. So statistically its kind of obvious where the bigger amount of retail investor money would flow.,What instinct? Isnt it all just gambling with these shitcoins? I watched TLs MM video within 10 minutes of release and I still didnt buy it because I think its a shitcoin that has no value and will never rise in price. I guess now I know never to doubt the power of the masses,Exactly, thinking in my perspective as a person with above average intelligence does not bring financial gains. I unironically think that the ability to read the masses and where theyre going is a far superior tool as an investor, which is absolutely retarded,Normies, its almost always the answer. I overhear all the watercooler talk about crypto and its so misguided and stupid these normies have no idea what they are talking about. They spread rumors about Bitcoin being backed by gold and Etherium being backed by silver. They said that Elon Musk created Dogecoin to sell Tesla cars and that safemoon was legally obligated to refund you if you lose money on it. These people are stupid, their choice of crypto is idiotic, their  research  is a bunch of facebook pajeet memes sliding into their DMs on social media shilling the coin of the week and these retards actually buy this stuff.,i dont want to believe this... its impossible... no way,Because its all trash and the  fundamentals  are usually entire companies/ products built around a simple function that shouldve been built into the main platform from inception, and theyre pumped to the max with zero revenue or real world work being done.Examples: eth is basically a decentralized spread sheet, and link the the graph perform very minor functions, that have yet to do any real world work outside of expanding the coin casino and making it more efficient. These products have valuations comparable to fortune 500 companies, and they perform one simple function on a decentralized spreadsheet.Use crypto to make some money near halvenings and put gains in real estate or capital equipment.,Clownmarket,Okay, but even a coin with the singular function of auto-posting  Hello World  for you on social media would have MORE INHERENT FUCKING VALUE THAN PONZICOINS WITH BILLION DOLLAR MARKET CAPS.YES, I AM SEETHING.,Better marketing,Sorry to say anon but its all true, these are boomers and non whites who have worked for minimum wage or near minumum wage jobs their entire lives. They purchase menthols, fast food, expensive alcohol (because it was shilled in a rap song), live off EBT and in section 8 housing. They are the lowest of the low, they buy ALL these shitcoins and get upset when they get rugpulled on their $20  investment in dey future .,why are you seething. you should learn how to profit from this.,As an intelligent investor, there IS a way to profit off of this behaviour right? Right?,I get what you mean. The fake fundamentals of decentralized (LOL) oracles seem vastly superior to breadcrumb consumers than Doge which doesnt even pretend to stop double spending, but as is often the case in tallest midget contests, the measurements and  value  end up getting skewed by other qualities. Doges mainstream memeabilty makes it a vastly more valuable commodity to lunch money investors trying to get rich than a centralized shit token price checker services fund raising token.,Trips confirm truth,Ride the intial pump wave on whatever the hot new coin is at the moment and sell early when the next one gains traction. Even if you miss out on profits you will be happy you made some money before the shitcoin went to 0.,Checked.Shitcoin profits are actually the only thing that saved my portfolio from financial devastation since the April/May crash.But it shouldnt fucking be this way. My  real  portfolio is full of good projects, I guarantee it. And yet they got dumped like worthless trash... no, in fact they got dumped WORSE than some worthless trash like Doge.,Im just so fucking scared that  being early  is just some myth to attract investors before the big rug or even a honeypot.I think MM was an exception rather than the rule, or am I wrong?,I feel the exact same way,I mean if youre supposed to make a profit out of these shitcoins, what are the first things you need to do before jumping in?Im so tired of being outperformed by normies that I want to profit off of them, thing is how?Please spoonfeed me anons on how to differenciate honeypot dead on arrival shitcoins from moonshot shitcoins that eventually rugpulls,I have to say its really been an instinct thing for me (or you could call it luck...?)Try to think like normies think.Does the coin have a strong meme (like... during dog coin mania, youd have to ponder if its a popular dog breed).Is it endorsed by e-celebs?Did it have a presale? (red flag if you werent part of the presale)Anyway, MM was quite an obvious play in hindsight and I mostly didnt buy because I swore off shitcoins after my success/failure ratio started skewing more towards negative in recent weeks.,dilate shithead, look at LINK, look at PNK - they all take much longer to pump, stop being retarded,Youre probably right and everything is just so overvalued/pre-pumped that early investors can freely dump whenever they feel like it and still walk away with tons of cash.Its all so tiresome...,I don’t know anon, I hate normies with all my soul and would dance on their graves in Minecraft, but I just can’t force myself to to participate in all those ponzies and rugpulls. It’s unethical for me. And yeah I’m pissed when those stupid fuckers make bank, but I know we’re living in the peak clown world and try not to care. Frankly I wouldn’t even know if I haven’t checked /biz/ out of boredom.,Memes, what are normies talking about on social media. Actually talking to normies helps alot. If you listen to their inane ramblings eventually you might find out what the hot new movie, sportsball, netflix show, dating app or diet trend is. Only talk about investments with them if you like to talk about crypto. To them you will be known as the investment guy and people will ask you about which coins they should buy or more likely which ones they bought. Dont be judgemental over their retarded purchases, remain aloof and supportive. If alot of people start to mention one coin BUY and in a few days to a week when normies are not talking about it anymore SELL. Never hold these coins longer than 3 weeks your average normie will have left for another  project  or lost their wallet at this point.,usually price follows after buildding team, community and product and that is what i see in CATE PLUG AXS,you can make some serious gains on shitcoins if you play it right. some may start as a shitcoin and turn out to be a gem. you need to dyor fag.,well there are people who make choices like these and I know that this is possibleit seems impossible but its really not,tell me this....why the fuck you wrote AXS? is it because you believe in it or just following the stupid hype?i swear that no one talks about any coin until it pumps,Let me DYOR if this is real or you shilling anon,my friend is PLUG whale. a lot of inside info coming from him. i am not a whale but i listend and bought some myself.,it will take years and years before there will be a demand for that kind of coin thoughbe ready to get old holding it,AXIE is not just a hype and i could see more ppl especially in the Philippines earning over $2000 EVERY MONTH DEPENDS how good you play and SLP keeps on increasing you moron : P : ),thats what they said about btc and eth. back in the day people said that there is no benefits of using crypto but look where are we now. in the end, patience is a virtue not a flaw you faggot,PLUGanyone providing liquidity for them atm,nah i just went to stake for liquidity mining event hoped for over 100% apy but 50-60% will do as well if it stays like that for the rest of the 24 weeks,i hated impermanent lose and cant afford to lose my cents anymore,soundWhat the fuck is your problem burgers? What the fuck does sound even means?,If you were an oldfag that actually spends his crypto youd know how that Dogecoin is unironically better currency than Bitcoin. Have fun paying $20 fees for a $10 steam card retard.,Im not a burger, but an investment that is not sound are clearly shilled pajeet rugs, for example.,still enjoying my 250% in PLUG/USDC pool looks like everything is working fine so far. hope there wont be some shitstorms,apparently it did take years for ETH to be used (only to be proven as a faulty launchpad for other blockchains) and BTC to be hyped (because it has no utility, according to its whitepaper and LoGiC),crypto is not for you. everything is risky stupid asssalty bitch everything here is a shill,I unironically think that the ability to read the masses and where theyre going is a far superior tool as an investor, which is absolutely retardedthats a basic requirement to be successful, you realized that only now? your IQ is probably around 100-110,eth, like all the other projects, is developing constantly. if it  faulty  like you called them why would they be no2. its not all black and white.,No I realized already that its a valuable skill, but not to the point of trumping over fundamental analysis and research of the asset were planning to invest on.I just realized how fundamentals and research doesnt mean shit if the normies aka the rest of the world doesnt know of its existence,someone who has the courage to provide liquidity in this bear marketcongrats roper, youll get robbed by the market every other second,i have seen this on MEXC exchange if this is the right token i thought,it just depends on the timescales you are looking at, on short time scales sentiment dominates on long time scale fundamentals do. Its the same as stocks its just crypto is so much more volatile and magnifies the affect.If you wanna try to get rich quick by all means try to read the masses, 9/10 times you are going to fail and lose your money. But maybe just consider it like VC investing. I am not good at this myself.,Anyways this isnt something thats correspondent to your intelligence, its simply experience and learning from it,they are listed on MEXC, you saw that right but also on LBank, ZT, Uniswap, BKEX... because they work with exchanges there will be more of them, ofc,Retards bro. They have enough hype to reach the retards. If you can get in one early enough to the shit coin you can make money off them. They see a coin with hype behind it going crazy and they fomo in thinking it will just keep going. But they always stop somewhere. Its really just pyramid scheme kind of thing where you not only have to get in early, you have to get out at the right time too.,yeah they have a number of exchanges as partners and they got listed on most of them after announcingmexc bkex lbank just from the top of my mid,I mean it is kinda gambling trying to pick one that the retards will flock to. Could do a 100-200x could rise a little and get dumped. But what these shit coins really are is a pyramid scheme.,in conclusion: Its all about how good in life you are,everything is gambling, thats why its interesting i guess.,Sometimes it definitely is. Instead of a ponzi trying to get normie those ones are rug pulls trying to get people like us.,There are no fundamentals in crypto because they generate no future cash flows,Here OP, an interesting thread from yesterday. People are thinking there might be more social media personalities copying million token in the coming weeks.,I you can tell what memes will take off and what memes wont, you can beat the average.Your well-researched spergcoin with  good fundamentals  and  use cases  are just forced memes.,Not necessarily roper lolPlugnet will be a big thing in the future because synthetic assets are yet to be discovered by the masses,there is also staking on LBank if is saw that right- its good to have options.,because there are no sound, fundamental, alts. its all a scam. normies picked up on this and just bought the most hyped scams. if everythings a scam, you buy the scam with the most upside, and with scams, upside=hype. we missed it because we made the mistake of thinking crypto had a future/was the future. its not. its a giant scam.,but price went to -X and when BTC hits 25k i would buy back more alts that has potential to fight its fundamental and pumpmental,my theory its same as relationshipsits easier to get people to commit to shitty flings, rather than a full blow serious relationshipSame way as micro transactions make you buy little trinkets for 99 cents or so, its easy, even if in the end it adds up to ludicrous amounts,i dont even try to explain that kind of thing to those fags with small and insignificant genitalia,for the simple fact that people want to make loads fast since theyve seen 0.01% of people make 1 million from DOGE or whateverinvesting in AVAX will never make you rich, a total shitcoin may do it. as small as your odds are, at least theres a chance of making a million starting from 100$ when you buy a craptokenhence why its also so incredibly hard to keep a shitcoin from dumping,After being in shitcoina for a while its hilarious seeing people lose their minds over a 5% swing in BTC or a 1% change in a boomer stock.,i got into the staking pool on lbank and got 50% apy but didnt check it in a whilei wonder if it will be better to move staking funds on their platform,synthetic assets still bothers on my head and it will remain unhyped,only if hype=your head kekfrom what I understand Plugnet will let you mirror your assets, the copy will be crosschain, and so you wont have to withdraw or unstake in order to have them available again.the only thing is that if you lose those copies, you lose your assets as well since they back the copies,Unironically, I think XMR has good fundamentals and solid use case, its all open source and there are no companies behind it. I agree that some other alts can be vaporware or pure speculation though, therefore making it no different from short term sentimental shitcoins.,OP, its ok, you missed MM and all the other shitcoins. Theres a new one that just got released. Buy $100 and hold as long as you can.trillion token, 1m market cap, unironically the next MMcontract: 0xecacab6725ac1711d97e55df35d525b863b8b9f7chart: Trillion Tokenhttps://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0xc03ac1e9c6946fed9e36732cebbcd73b0c7a0637,what if i do not need synthetic assets, how can i get back my original copy? noobs here no companies behind it? man youre just hallucinating,Okay, Ill bite. Spoonfeed me this token, whos behind it and what the plan is for the future,What do we call this new form of analysis? This is not technical or fundamental analysis. memetic analysis? i have great taste in memesthe general public not so muchbut just as a good sommelier will choose a wine for his customers palette and not his own, we must determine the memetic tastes of  retail retards  and anticipate a memetic analysis based on that.,thats good adviceif i wanted to talk to normies on 4chan, which board is the normie board if any?,normieschanGo to Reddit and Twitter anon, maybe Discord if you know the servers to go to, Smart  investment is about long term value since you cant predict the ebb and flow of speculative money. The fact you dont understand that means youre also dumb money.-t bought BTC in March 2013, never sold,Right I suppose the moment I dove myself into something fundamental I should expect long term gains rather than these short term gains based on sentiment investing. But then again I want to 100x my money like the dumb moneys do kek,There are people who dont understand bitcoin or ethereum or any of the coins at all, not even the basic concepts, too alien. But theyre too dumb to know they dont understand. So to them there is literally no difference between bitcoin and uncledogemoon aside from one has a cuter image and more immediate potential upside. They treat it like theyre collecting pokemon cards, like all of crypto is just  fun digital collectors tokens  no different from a stamp collection,They spread rumors about Bitcoin being backed by gold and Etherium being backed by silver. They said that Elon Musk created Dogecoin to sell Tesla cars and that safemoon was legally obligated to refund you if you lose money on it.Holy shit,oof, i guess namefagging a prerequisite for talking to normies then,Wanting to get a quick 100X is why youll never 1000X like me. And what did I do after I saw it 1000X after 8 years, I continued to hodl because BTC is still the best long term investment on the market.,baste maxi,Anon please tell me you didnt miss the biggest financial opportunity of your lifetime for not investing in memecoins?You know memes are the most powerfull social construct phenomenon right? Please tell me you didnt go against the market and you profitted heavily off normies on memecoinsIts actually a very easy way to make it if you know what you are doingYou just have to see the signs and know whats metaIve made literally 1 Million on memecoins alone this bullrun,Teach me the ways anon, can I do it by simply browsing biz? Or should I browse Twitter and Reddit as well? I genuinely think sentiment investing is the way to go in a short term,You need to get in telegram groups because thats where it all starts. By the time it hits reddit, its usually too late., smart  investormakes no money idiot  investorgoes 100x on doge in a week bc the icon made him laughyou guys really dont get it, every time a whitepaper is published its a sell signal that the coin is destined for crabcity,lolmost shitcoins make people lose money,Selection bias. Youre coveting the success of the tiny minority of gamblers who won, and ignoring the legions of bagholders who need to lose money for a single memecoin trader to come out substantially ahead. Or are you just counting the paper, unrealized gains of a bunch of smoothbrains at some arbitrary point in time and calling it a day? LmaoWhen theres no true utility/equity in a project and no prospect of future bona fide value, its literally just a casino. Are you mad that there are lottery winners? Are you upset that good poker players can live off of hosing chumps at the tables in Vegas or Atlantic City?,Stop being so analytical and trust your gut more. Fundamentals are worthless without the masses/hype.Xerox had some great R D and  Fundamentals  but it all amounted to absolutely nothing. Chad Apple won.,Easiest way is through presales, dxsale/whitelists if youre a normie pleb, OTC/Private presales if youre a chad with connections/tranny influencerBut you can still make it without it, study the meme market, immerse yourself in it, see whats meta. For a time all doge tokens pumped, then safemoon clones pumped, then it was the time of GUH clones, then it was Porn Tokens, then Tiki Clones, then Buyback/Everrise clones, then doge tokens again, and mix of these.Check for obvious signs of scams/rugs or fake engagements, if TG channels are too botted, if you have basic coding skills learn to read the contracts and check for any sus activity, if you know the safemoon, everrise, tiki contracts, congratulations you already covered 90% of the meme coin contracts out there.Hang around in TG channels and Biz for intel, you wouldnt believe the amount of huge memecoins (that made it to 50M+) that were posted here sub 500K Mcap. Reddit Cryptomoonshots is good only if you filter by new, and you have to filter 99% of the shit/scams there. But reddit CMS is actually the way these coins get 90% of their degen gambler normies, if a coin isnt able to get frontpage on reddit CMS its not even worth it because they probably dont know what theyre doingCheck for events that may pump the coin, normies love that shit, no matter how small it is, like CG/CMC listing, new website, ads on charting platforms. Check trending dextools/poocoin (good to know whats meta but not necessarily as good to buy because it might be too late)Sometimes these pump a few weeks into it, if theres work being put into them and community shilling/advertising going on, but Dont be left holding the bags for too long.,adding that small or tight communities on discord are also a great way of finding out these plays, Im on a channel with a few big memecoin millionaires (mostly safemoon etc), and we always share the best memeplays and talk about whats meta. You can also build connections and maybe get into presales, etc this way.,if you invest in new shitcoins you can say  i am in this from the beginning.. no bagholders before me... this might really do x multiples like y coin ,Because the market was led by Elon and the rest, and their army of fucking morons. There are projects(even low caps) with a great potential but its hard to get to them because all the shit coins,This is gambling not investing.,Fuck the low caps rn. You dont know which one will survive. Invest in the new projects that have a potential like holoride.is now a good time to buy chain link?,BEE idwhy ask us anon?,wait for 5$, exit at 8$,anything under 5k is a great price.,No. 10$ eoy. Dont waste your time on this scam.,yesI have about 5k to invest into alts.Which one should I buy? NEAR, Fantom, AVAX, Sushi, GRT, Dusk,in GRT we trust,Buy AVAX and yield farm on pangolin for comfy passive gains,GRT is so fucking based ffsalso, maybe a bit random, but to ask since staking - did anyone try staking API3 yet? any reports on the rewards?,re rewards - 1 year lock up and after that weekly rewards to be disbursed, mainly directed at believers and whale holders, but I feel its gonna be a good play, Midhav and the pajeet army dont fuck around,The next big thing is definitely GPOOLBuy into GPOOL launchpad for a reasonable initial investment, there will be no complicated tiers, but just ONE tier making all investors equal when launched .Dont miss out,Im mostly invested in NEAR. I like the approach to make blockchain and smart contracts so easy to use that eveb non-devs can play with it and set up smart contracts,FORMs leverage yield farming with over 21k% APY anon and early adoption program and rewards claiming on Alpaca is live  WGMI,AVAX, Pangolin, HUSKY and eSTINKY,HBAR is literally all you need,Smart man. NEAR is my pick too. Never talked about on biz which I consider bullish. Nice active community, very welcoming for building,the platform is solid as rock, the audits really took too fucking long but Im glad they took that time to make it werk. I just love everything API3 builds, the UX is just amazing.AVAX and Pango are really, really amazing if you got the cash to play,based husky chad,Never forgetti whale sama and thanks to jax I buyed on day 1.,get a bag of $znn and stake them. You will thank me later,+15 points credit to your account! good work rajesh!,At this moment $CWS should be accumulated, Seascape is the best NFT project Ive come across, change my mind,thank you for your kind words my friend. my village needs food so i will give my best.,sell me on GRT and I might consider stacking some, anons,Fantom, yield farming is something 4chan has no idea about and u can literally print money on fantom rn just by staking,this is now a zenon thread. If you can’t handle the momentum get out,change my mindYou are a cocksucking nigger. Quod erat demonstrandum.,ETH, obviously,Accumulate ZNN and QSR, Freund.,fucking this, Im so goddamn bullish on them,Chromia and Fantom,Over 1m RAIL has already been staked and in addition, staking is live on the platform.The tokenomics and privacy as a use case for Railgun is something you dont wanna miss,based RAIL shill, GMIall of my bags are on hereRAILAPI3ZNNWAGMI frens,I would take AVAX and NEAR in your list and you can add FWT REEF ETC if you ask me,go look at the ISO 20022 compliant onesonly those and a few select others will survive the next big crash,NEAR, Fantom, AVAX, Sushi, GRT, Dusknone of those. i remember that sushi rug, it gives me goosebumps each time i remember. find something useful, not this shady stuff,fuck! cheapest platform i ever heard anon,Very rare to see Dusk mentioned here. Its extremely undervalued right now imo,Near is a good one if you can afford a big bagFWT still launching the app today?,i remember thats a PONZI and i would never invest that scheme,fwt app is already launched as far as i know. they are just giving the access to their app today. stop spreading false info,Apparently shittalkers are hereCould you state your reasons?I doubt Near is a ponzi and just looked at Fwt which is not anywhere near a ponzi apparentlyAre you that dude employed by banks to chat shit about competitors?,they launched their mainnet already, for how long do we have to wait for that ffs,you know shit because only the lite app was launched and today theres the full featured Freeway app that will be launched whats the false info anon gave?,fuck the banks do not ever mention BANKS here and am allergic to that,its not a full app that you gonna get access to but the Lite version still. go and check for yourself shitfag.,banks are doomed to fall, its just a matter of time. stealing cant be sustainable much more. people will realize that sooner or later.,Invest in $CVP power pool. Its the highest traded token on uniswap at the moment. But if you are interested in diversification of funds you should try $YLA power pool is a cash-flow generating index composed of 5 different stable coins. You earn 12% APY on stable coins and 28% APY on $CVP,you clearly shilling can you atleast remove $$$$ sign? lol nigger,anon has no clue what hes talking aboutyour discord made me get out of my comfort zone and actually find the twitter accountyou get a banana for being right,no fees at all! avax for sure!,Avax will conquer wall st,Invest in $YLA. $YLA is a dynamic portfolio ...you earn 12% APY on stable coins and 28% APY on $CVP and it rebalancing nature keeps $YLA high no matter what.,Catch the NFT trend. Dont be a fool, look AXS, FLOW, LOCG are on the rise. I will grow my LOCGame bag because the game will be launched soon.,I know its a really hard choice but you need to make it. (Hint: its Avax),not decentralized, never will be. you niggers are just as bad as the hashgraph retards,they are the biggest scammers in the world with their crystal palaces. we need a revolution!down with the banksback to bronze age,Altcoins are not enjoying this Bitcoin bear trend...Thats why when given a chance, I buy more AVAX I already have in my portfolio.,I think everyone should have some AVAX in their portfolio, it is the best long-term investment there is,sounds like the social network effects is where the ponzi falls and looks unsustainable,avax is childs play.,thats what we all should do. a little research wont kill you but help you to make a decision. poorfags will never learn. they like everything served on a plate,freeway is alrighthashgraph is alrightavax is alrightshilling is alright,what about a 33% fixed apy on BTC and 43% apy on USD and EUR,You know how to identify toxic people? Its where people do a shitposting whithout any supporting evidence that would clear everything,you forgot that freeway will also have staking for gold and many other assets that will be pushed slowlytokenization at its best,you came to 4chan to talk about toxicity, we cherish that here,Avax is a good one but their partner albt is so much fucking better theyre also partnered with ocean ewt gbg link bmi inj hbar,Which one is the best here dude? freeway team has superb experience when it comes to biz hashgraph has adopted in japan avax is moving,i dont know any other platform that does the same thing.,my friend got the early access and he said that it works fine. he is staking there for quite some time now.,they are not competitors so there is no comparison between the three but if you think about ROI you might want to take a lot of things in considerationkeep in mind that none is 100% guaranteed and you might lose everything...thats crypto,diversifying is good when you have extra funds to invest in some coins that would give your x100,FTM, GRT and BAT,it also has 20% apy for dot bnb and eth but the biggest ROI should be from the coin though,this is pretty big and would consider researching if this is fuckin legit exactly as i didit might fall to 10K again,Fantomngmi tranny,Got you. -JaxAlso buy FTM. I still believe in AVAX, and know its time will come. But FTM is next to bat, I see the writing on the wall.,Gtfo with avax and other shit you talking bout. Tou only need to buy $ZNNWhy would anyone invest in a project that has absolutely zero GitHub activity?…Retards,Something something private github, something something its meaningless, etc etc,fuck you im literally losing my life savings and you are laughing at me?I just realized from pic related that gas stations in the us serve skimmed milkI dont think Ive ever seem a single gas station do that here in europeHow do I profit off this?Where do I find figures about milk sale profit in gas station to investigate?Ive been sitting on the sidelines the whole year and i just went all in, i put my life savings in BTC, ETH and LINK what am i in for? I have 0.9 BTC, 5 ETH and 900 LINK,Why now? Surely this is a larp,Should have waited for the bottom anon.Still better than people who payed SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS for ONE bitcoin,not going to look great for the next few years anon. i hope by all in you didnt mean your life savings.,You too early bro,How does 20k sound?,All will rise again. Cryptocurrencies are on the way. And I thought my ROSE bag wouldnt go far. But the technological innovations they brought, the finance and google collaborations made me think positively. HODL.,youre not too early, but it could take a year to recover/increase. as long as you can pay rent/bills while waiting, youre gonna make it, boy.,You should have put your money in $YLA power pool . You earn 12% APY on stable coins and 28% APY on $CVP and because it always rebalance $YLA APY always goes up,Ive been waiting months for  20k  to happen but it just seems like its not going to happen, i just had this feeling like its gonna go up soon and ill be priced out forever so i fomod,You did well anon. Add some COMP to that stack if you truly want to make it. No need to thank me later.,Noob here as well, heres what I bought over the weekend:$2,000 BTC$1,000 ETH$1,000 XRP$1,000 XMR$1,000 LINK$1,000 ADA$1,000 DOTPlease tell me how retarded I am. Also, here is my  watch list  of things I might get into:HEXHBARFTMROSE,Too diversified. General rule is 50/25/25 with 50 being BTC and 25 being ETH and a shitcoin of your choosing,another 50% down at least and then crabbing for 3 years - enjoy,Oh no the fucking biz shills got you on the LINK shit I wont buy that shit even with a gun to my head. BTC and ETH are good, something new with lots of potential like pinknode would have made the list perfect.,Why?,Fucking normies, did you bother DYOR before buying any of those or you just got on n off biz and decided to go skin diving.

ETH is the next reliable coin after BTC but is still beholden to BTC price fluctuations hence why thats only 25% of your portfolio compared to BTCs 50%. The remaining 25% of your portfolio should be going to an altcoin that has a lower marketcap since those have a higher potential reward. If you want a more riskier portfolio you can forgo ETH and go two altcoins but 50% of it should still be in BTC,Because his favorite youtuber, (((Benjamin Cohen))) says so.

If you were all in on alts and didnt pull out youre down upwards of 90% plus during a full blown bear market most altcoins die and never recover hence 50% of portfolio being BTC.,Confirmation this is not the bottom.,this is unironically you,BASED. i dont know whats gonna happen but something big is brewing. whether it is up or down, i dont know.At what age did you give up on your dreams to change the world or doing a “something you love”, and accept the crushing inevitability of wage slaving?t. 29,Idk 2nd grade I think,Figured out that I was probably going to live in a studio and microwave all of my meals in 4th grade.,Feel sorry for you guys giving up so early.For me, it was when I got rejected by VCs for funding a startup.

That meant that if you started in company A, you would work on company A for your entire life if you wanted to work in that field. That ensure low wages. I only found out about this when my (now previous) boss got sick and couldnt work anymore, so his brother had to take up the company temporarily so he could end it, and he admitted that was the common practice. He was old and retired so he didnt give a fuck.,, been a corpo slave since two years now, if BTC goes 100k+ im free,at around 25. although my dreams were to get rid of gypsies, jews and the corrupt govt. then I realized how deep we are in and just accepted nihilism,I dont know, I got a job at a nice EV startup working as an electronic engineer and it feels almost like a hobby.

Funnily enough, it made me a happier person. Work then just became something I did to fund the  real  parts of my life. I stopped being invested in it emotionally.

I will learn react javascript frontend so I will know the whole stack Im working on.,How the fuck is trading any different from working other job?But to answer OPs question, i already achieved my dream (get accepted to medschool) and i saw that achieving a dream doesnt truly change anything. I also realised along the way that  changing the world  is a pipe dream and a single human is so weak that it cannot change almost anything at all during its life. When it comes to society, are all cogs in a machine by nature. Better accept it.,I never had dreams, I stopped leaving my house after high school.,well if your dream was to be accepted into a school i am not surprised it didnt chane anything,Thanks to my years on /pol/ i also developed another dream of getting into politics but also thanks to /pol/ i realised how futile all that shit is.,sure my guy. Its not a 100% bulletproof thing but here is the basics:Ive been working fulltime for 3 years now. I havent changed my lifestyle since university times (no car, small appartment i share with gf etc) and I playn to continue with this lifestyle for years to come. This way I save 65% of my (not so good) net income. In the past years I put the majority of that saved money into ETH which worked quite well, in the peak a few months ago my portfolio was at 360k. Obviosuly its much less now, around 180k€ currently. But I dont doubt ETH/BTC reaching their previous ATHs again so I just have to wait for that. This year I dont invest at all but instead save up cash for emergencies and other shit (like being able to quit my job when I absolutely cant endure the agony anymore) and be fine for a year or two without touching my investments. In the comming years I split my investments between an world ETF (FTSE All World for example) crypto and some peer 2 peer (popular in europe but not really a thing in the US i believe). This way Im investing about 14k€ a year in different shit. I hope that with my crypto investment and the future of stocks Ill end up with roughly 800k by the time Im 40. Due to my cheap lifestyle I could quit working with 500k€ and only use 4% of my total networth each year to live off. Obviosuly, the more the better so I try to make more money (pay raises, selling shit...) and try to automate most of my life. Like the returns of my peer 2 peer investment pay my monthly cost for (public) transport etc. Next thing it will pay is my cost for food, then rent etc. Thats about it, I dont need much to be happy, I just dont want to spend my time working on something I dont like and I havent been able to monetize what I like just yet so its this plan so far,something you love used to be something meaningful before i realised its all worthless. now its banging east asian hookers while off my tits on coke. ill wageslave and invest for the next 10 years and then jump on a plane and live like nero until i have a heart attack or something,Thanks to my years on /pol/Oh youre a retard, thanks for pointing out,always the same anons n pics in the wagie threads,Im gonna kill myself, Im too fucking retarded to hold down any job and dont wanna be homeless,i think once you hit that number its all over, body is in decline, you realise you arent getting any smarter, taller or healthier. teenagers wont fuck you anymore and 40 is basically death, only women left have slammed so hard into the wall you can never get aroused the same way again. unironically if you havent made it by 30 then you are in for a rough ride.,Nice counter arguments, fag.,I fucked a 18 year old and 31 year old in the timespan of two weeks and honestly didnt see a difference in the quality of sex.

But I realized that making music was more fulfilling anyway, and I have a comfy stem job that allows me to afford everything I need, so now I pass the time making music after working.,kek couldnt be me.,I got disillusioned at around 20-21. I finished Uni at 24 with zero experience (I am also crippled and my family is pretty poor/unsuccesful), did a project from home for about a year as my first job ever, then did nothing for almost a year, then found something more stable (still freelance basically, but technically full-time) when I just turned 26 and this was my first  real job . Immediately got the best deal for the market, basically, although it didnt net me that much money on a monthly basis.Then I decided I wanted to diversify and do something else also, as I dont beleive my profession will persist for many decades, so I found a completely new job, just started. Now I work two jobs, both from home. I am currently 28 and got into crypto this March so well see how it goes. Never been in an office in all my life.,im 33I wage, but I have lived few years jobless. Hustling is super easy, never lacked money. Frankly, I went to this last job to learn, but sadly I feel betrayed - they pretended to be mentors, just to never really teach anything. They are more concerned about their personal sideprojects than the company.. I am saddened that this shitshow was my home for few years, I really wanted to be a part of something. I expect to leave soon and join few very experienced friends who are going into car trade and construction. At the end of the day, sadly, losers will always be losers no matter what they appear. I have been raised to expect leadership and maturity from management, and to work in equally respectful manner, and most importantly - that all workers understand and work towards a single goal. This job lacks goals. I have put this issue on the table few times, but the answers are weak and uncertain. No fear of leaving, as apparently I am smart enough to survive with rather ease, but I regret losing years of life working towards nothing. At the end of the day the old gang from highschool reunites to work and learn on their own. How stupid it was to lose 10+ years wandering about, just to go back and do business with friends... life is funny.,self employed is same as waging you exchange time for moneybusiness is almost the same - you exchange even more time for money (but with added bonus of having opportunity to scale your work amount and income slightly)the best is obviously to have a company that works autonomously, but the initial capital or organizing skill level is very high to accomplish this. This imho is the true non-waging state.,Aparently there was kind of a deal between the companies in my region, where one company wouldnt  steal  employees from each other. That meant that if you started in company A, you would work on company A for your entire life if you wanted to work in that field. That ensure low wages.thats cartel and is illegal. Though I have same example with the bars in my capital city - the bar owners all know each other. And the waiters and bartenders just circulate endlessly among all of them. When someone lacks money, they fire people, and take in new ones. The old ones circulate to next bar. The low wages are ensured by constant firing/going away and rehiring. Same happened with lawyers btw - many companies take in new students, give them entry level wages and then throw them out after 6 months, just to take in new batch. Bootlickers probably can stay, rest are circulated. Its easier to circulate 100 new ones and randomly find a smarter one, than to educate 1.,i didnt, my dream is that i survive the apocalypse created by idiots of our time.

Still pursuing my YouTube dream and dont plan to stop. Plan to create more channels in the future until one becomes bigger than my original channel.,I had a working prototype, funding model and everything. But they didn’t like my idea of helping people without jobs gain new skills and job placements, which I found strange, but not surprising. Employers really don’t want to pay for training because it’s “risky”. Made me realize what a shitty society we live in,thats cartel and is illegal.I know, unfortunately I cant do anything about it. Too many bootlicker employees without a brain that would just witness in favor of their boss in case you took it to the court.People suck. And theyre not even big companies, its small 10~15 employees offices. Small businesses are as greedy and shitty as big corporations. If they can fuck you over, they will. I refuse to be part in any of this and I will do everything I can to avoid wageslaving for someone again. If I cant make a living like Im doing now, I will look for some piss easy government job instead.,Never. I work on music and other ventures in parallel until I can fully transition.,Age 20 when I was working for my university at a nightshift job. The job itself was easy, but the way that and class crushed my ability to sleep really let me know how it was going to be. And I realized I could never do this all the way through a doctorate to do science like what I read about as a child. So instead I cut out at a bachelors and am a bureaucrat who barely does anything for a fair amount of money. Slaving, but in a bearable way. Cant imagine being a retailcuck or something like that.,21 i realized this world fucking hates me after daddy took away my Ferrari after my DUI.

I think $500/week in cc income will allow me to do this comfortably,I hope you make it. That dream has seemed so comfy yet it seems so far.,After waging for a year ive realized how achievable it really is. 25% returns a year on calls opens so many possibilities.

Arbitrum natively supports ERC 677 and has complete EVM compatibility.Once the beta portion of Arbitrum is open there is no technical limitation to onboarding the first 100 high value enterprises who want to take the value of X, confirm Y and draft 80 payments to 30 different entities with cryptographic proof of performance available exclusively to each partner and nobody else.The reason youre seeing swift and all the years-long sales cycles start to complete is that the team actually understands what enterprise needs. The entire chainlink network is the bespoke enterprise solution rather than tech built with the hopes a customer finds it useful.SmartContractSummit 1 is the launch of the new economyJust like telecom used to be expensive, this will too, at firstThen one day the collective mind will flip from  smart contracts are an innovative technology  to  smart contracts are the only reasonable way to conduct business When that happens Chainlink will become the assetized version of trust. The concept of owning chainlink on Eth1 will be as abnormal as owning good delivery bars as an individual. The concept of people becoming rich through stocks will be as quaint as people becoming rich through gold mining today. Smart contract infrastructure holders will hold an asset not tied to the performance of one executive team or one product class, but rather the overall market progress of the world.The first modern trillionaires and deca-trillionaires will be normal people who bought link under a dollar and held for 20 years or wealthy people with the  vision  to buy at $100 and hold for years.Chainlink doesnt compete for value. Chainlink unlocks more value than the internet and captures it almost in its entirety.,Imagine for a second that the smart contract outputs you need arent token transfers (maybe you could call it  moving beyond tokenization ) but rather legally compliant payments that enterprises must make within legacy banking systems.Those payments obviously suffer from a lot of disadvantages in that they are more highly regulated and can take longer to post.But they do have one little advantage: they dont post to a blockchain.And maybe one other: if youre looking to a decentralized blockchain as your source of trust, you only need to post a hash of the last X transactions (that the relevant parties can verify) to the baselayer.That would mean that the winners in this new smart contract economy would be (in order of importance):The input, computation and output layerThe legally required banking payments layerThe baselayer,Literally the saddest link thread in a while. Like some trauma denial mechanism.,Over any reasonable macro frams Chainlink has outperformed one of the best investments in the history of the world (BTC)Note also that BTC has been feature complete for quite some time and is unlikely to create novel value propositions to capture, rather than continuing to capture its current value propositionContrast that with Chainlink,Chainlink is proportional ownership of the Chainlink network which includes all the relevant inputs a smart contract economy needs, all the relevant outputs and all of the relevant functionality (deco, vrf, towncrier, candid, fss)For applications like defi which have outputs that involve tokens, there is some value capture to the base layer (Eth+Arbitrum or Eth2+Arbitrum)For the higher volume, higher value applications for enterprise (which do not use token transfers as the outputs) the value capture of the baselayer is negligible. It doesnt matter whether arbitrum fees are eth or link, or btc or any other asset. Nearly all the value for the highest volume, highest value portion of the smart contract economy is already owned by Chainlink.,bagholder cope very cringe,Microsoft understood that the operating system software portion of a computer was as valuable as the hardware in a time when this notion was laughableIf Microsoft had realized that all of the non-hardware portions of the computer value proposition (internet search, social media, streaming video, video games etc.) had the same potential and used their insight to corner these markets before they even existed they would be on the same level as what the Chainlink team has doneThey started by securing the bank payments portion of the smart contract stack. That portion wouldnt be relevant for years and millions of lines of code in the future. That kind of value generating foresight has never before been seen.Jeff Bezos understood that you could sell physical goods over the internet and eventually make the experience better than in person stores. When delivering books in a reasonable timeframe was hard the thought of Amazon having any real value was crazy talk.It will all be easy to see in retrospect that a protocol level asset that automates trust will be worth a significant proportion of the worlds trust assurance services, but for now its crazy talk.,how much LINK is enough to make it?, million,,This thread is about the appreciation of Chainlink and their team, the breadcrumbs, the spoonfeeding, the memes, and the engineering that is required to make functioning decentralized oracles.,Vitalik makes UNI oracle threadintentionally designed as low-frequency/high-latency oraclespecifically mentions Optimismmentions lots of weird quirky constraints that it will need to have which dont make sense on initial inspectionHere is the deal. Optimisms business model is to Auction off MEV. Every single block on Optimism will need to have near optimal MEV extraction for this to be economical.This presents a problem when we think about oracles. If you are the block sequencer on Optimism, where will you put the oracle update transactions? Where ever they are most profitable for you. And in extreme cases you can actually censor them. Yes I know some Optimism fag will tell you how they added some feature to prevent censorship, but without disclosing specifics I am categorically telling you they cannot promise true censorship resistance on Optimism in its current design.This is a huge problem for oracles obviously.The reason for the high-latency nature of Vitaliks oracle is to make the oracle update window span far enough into the future that the MEV aspect happens less frequently. How ever, whichever lucky sequencer manages to catch the occasional oracle update gets a nearly guaranteed fat arbitrage, as it has been hours or potentially days since the last oracle update, so the arbs will be fucking huge.The fatass giga arb is what will incentivize the sequencers to actually include the oracle update in the block. Otherwise they would just keep trading on grossly mispriced assets.This setup provides nearly guaranteed MEV against protocols which use oracles. Optimism needs MEV to fuel their revenue. If this kind of design was not used, the MEV could potentially dry up as protocols get smarter at designing around MEV and actually giving a shit about their users.This is a bit of a dirty secret, but idgaf.

Im just fucking tired, Im really struggling being a wage slave. Some days are better than others, but this past week has been really tough for me. Mentally and physically Im just exhausted, and seeing the state of crypto is fucking demoralizing. Im still not convinced this is the end of the bull run... if it is Im going to be pretty devastated.,Partners with SWIFT, -2.4%I see it now, kek.,cool thread but can it stop dumping for a minute?,Take a break from looking at portfolio and crypto markets. Watching LINK is like watching paint dry. wage slavery feelsFrankly being a wage slave sucks but I guess that you are overly invested into LINK because of wagecuckery. Should never be the case, LINK should be treated as a solid investment/lottery ticket type of stuff but not your only way to make it. If you too concerned about the price but not realizing the trend where LINK is going (in terms of production, network effects and dominating the entire space) then you will get emotionally affected easily and make shitty decisions.Also this board is full of anti LINK and retarded psyops atm so forget browsing here for the next 5-6 months. Just leave this place man.,Yeah. Ive stopped checking the price recently after checking it multiple times every day. There was no real purpose to it, it was pretty much an addiction. I do find myself browsing /biz/ less and less, its just so fucking retarded now.,Just leave /biz/ and come back occasionally when there is a big happening (white paper 2.0 release) every now and then. Im comfy with my stack and price ATM, although realistically speaking yes I do think the bull is probably over (we entered all stages including euphoria/mania, anything else is just copium),Then why are you commenting about such a sad token?,Based effort poster I commend you.,Bump because Bulgarian slide and Discord seethe threads are out in full force right now,Anon, thank you for doing this. But I am so demoralized. I have been accumulating LINK since last year and only managed to get to 4000 LINK as of now. I was very optimistic a few weeks ago. But at this point I realised, that I am never gonna make it,based info dump I collected and formatted it all.,Based op,You are a MANIAC!,What about stacks 1-5k. Are we destined to wage cuck forever??,Alright, I just got my wagie payraise, should I DCA into Chainlink (ticker: LINK)? Ive been really skeptical, its between this and Polygon, Ive seen the Sergey   Lex Fridman interview and I really loved what Sergey had to say its just I am so confused as to why I see these constant fucking threads of people specifically fudding LINK. My time horizon is 2035 and beyond because I am a young cunt but is LINK something that will be in the range of $500/$1000+ etc? I want to become a LINK marine its just I am unsure.,As a side note I mean start DCAing into LINK, I dont need the extra money so I want to look for another token to add it to my make it wallet.,They FUD LINK because its funny to keep newfags like you outits by actual noLINKers who hate the projectits by paid faggots that run their own CeFi ponzi and short LINK to make money (search in the wakarimasen archive for NEXO and check this thread out . Wallet autists once exposed these faggot platforms once sent 1.5 million LINK during the May correction to crash LINK with no survivors).Polygon is a nothingburger in the long run. LINK will capture value like nothing you have ever seen before. See pic related.,Sell it all and buy LINKBULL for now.,Thank you anon, I really appreciate it.,If you ever had any doubt on the long term potential and implications of LINK (seems that you are talking about a time horizion of 2035), then read all the threads and links OP posted and sent. Read them slowly and take your time. Save this thread somewhere.Also watch as the fucking fudding trannies do shit like these:Really makes you think eh. What project has faced so much FUD on /biz/? Why do they want us to sell so much?,Really makes you think eh. What project has faced so much FUD on /biz/? Why do they want us to sell so much?Thats been one of the biggest things for me, like good Lord its just constant across /biz/ and crypto-twitter.,Also read thisdelusional schizo coping bagholders,I will tell you the truth. It is because LINK is inherently a monopoly (meaning that no other competitors comes close), and will create emerging markets beyond Defi (which was only enabled because of Chainlink price feeds and kickstarted a new cycle and bullrun). LINK in its white paper 2.0 vision extends beyond just price feeds and an oracle framework, but has become a middleware layer that can deal with off chain computation (i.e take the heavy load off ETH), privacy features (confidential data is a big must for enterprise adoption/regulatory compliance and settlement of derivatives and just about every other shit big banks need). Obviously this doesnt bode well to certain coin maxis, as well as people who have doubted LINK for years. Theres so much more that anons can tell you about, but nobody can do the research and final decision for you.Like I said, read the threads and go figure. I was once like you (kek). Eventually something clicks for you hopefully and you begin to scramble to accumulate as much as you can irregardless of the price, as I did a few years back when everything fit into place. Good luck.,Thank you.,Heres proof that I am not bullshitting you on the noLINKer saltiness. And as you can see, faggots are starting to flood the fucking thread kek.,Nico is being used by pajeet fuddersI am disgusted.,pic relatedAnd because I am feeling nice today, thread related was the one that made it  click  after some research on LINK.https://warosu.org/biz/thread/S9706231,also watch out for FUD. one of the FUD items is that Chainlink has pivoted to DeFi because no enterprises are interested in what they are offering. I think rather Sergey realized that DeFi is real and that all banks are going to want to plug into it. Heres an example from just a few days ago:https://www.coindesk.com/venture-arm-thailand-siam-commercial-bank-defi-disrupt-traditional-financeAnother FUD item is that you dont need aggregation for a piece of information that comes from one person. this is actually true but the reason its not FUD is because Chainlink is aiming at things like insurance and derivatives where everyone needs what Sergey calls  definitive truth.  its not just one person posting a personal piece of information to a blockchain.,Damn that guy had 950k+ LINK, I hope he is still holding it Yeah I imagine that Sergey, after speaking to people over at Swift is much more in the know with how banks are eventually going to hookin to crypto and defi, I doubt theyre going to sit idly by and get put out to pasture.,bunch of shill threadssome literal whos said LINK is the best, who fucking caressuper linear staking!!111yeah, just wait 3 more years for staking bromixiclesdecounproven shit that arent even operational right nowripple-tier old ancient  breadcrumbs zero proofs, conjecture, speculation and hopiummarketingall this shit is some autist enganging in extreme apophenia due to his emotional attachment to his invesment, also called sunk cost fallacy.Arbitrum live in a matter of weekshe essentially is trying to create hype, nothing more nothing lesst.frustrated holderinb4 bulgarian tranny nolinker seething fagidgaf if you believe me or not as OP said, DYOR,How long have you been holding,i remember this fren., days, bought a shit ton in July and December 2018,So youre up on your investment no?What makes you frustrate?,Im up x100 from my lowest entry point, yes, but my expectations for this cycle were sky high thanks to all the schizos posting here, acting like its a certainty. I am extremely frustrated that literal shitcoins managed to outperform me in this cycle so far, not to mention that DOGE had a higher ROI in 6 months than LINK had over a span of 4 years.Im mostly frustrated with myself for not diversifying into some BTC or ETH, instead of being all in.,Are you under 30, 30-40, or 40+ I mean either way theres time, no matter what the grass is greener somewhere. What do you think LINK is going to? What is your end sell target?,feel you anon, similar position only I actually fucked up by trying to trade during the crash. the last 2 months have been a literal nightmare,mid 20s, yes theres still time obviously. I honestly dont know, obviously I still believe in it because Im still holding but despite SWIFT and all that shit, my faith in the project has been shaken.It all seems eerily similar to xrp connections years ago, which at the time looked solid and helped XRP pump to a $160 billion market cap, but after all these years it turns out nothing fucking mattered and that the fudders were right, the SEC fucking sued them lol.Now if the LINK shills are right, then the sky is the limit and it could realistically reach a 4 digit valuation in the next 5 years, just like ETH.Im planning to sell 10% of my stack at $100, $200, $400 etc and keeping 1k LINK for staking.The main reason Im so frustrated with the current performance is that LINK was supposed to have an ETH like performance this cycle according to the shills, which again at that time seemed reasonable considering the actual importance and current usage of the network. I even remember posts comparing ETH/BTC to LINK/BTC in late 2020, providing even more high expectations and false hopes.,That is the hard part isnt it, being reasonable and realistic with things seems to be a rarity on /biz/ yt, twitter etc. Its like politics, just learning to be rather apathetic to it, to the noise which might be a good skill for holding projects like LINK with actual value,how much link do you have ?,being reasonable and realistic with thingsnailed it, LINK shills, including twitter fags, do not represent the silent majority of holders, they are obnoxious and completely divorced with reality, and are giving a very bad reputation to the project. They also tend to ignore or ridicule any serious attempt to discuss Chainlink in a negative way (such as Chainlink Labs hiring a bunch of left-wing roasties in order to appeal to  diversity quotas  or some shit) and are generally insufferable smug cunts that do not even entertain the idea that their bet might fail. Nothing is certain you emotional faggots, especially in investing.,God is dumping LINK until my IRA transfers and I can put everything into LINK. Just one more week gentlemen.,~6klel only 6k I was a poorfag, and it doesnt make a difference, if I was holding 30k I would feel even worse for not selling at least 5% at some point. It only gets worse the more you have.,I understand that people make fuck loads of cash, 10x,100x,1000x+ their initial capital but being invested in a reasonable project like LINK, that isnt going to rug etc is important to me as an investor. And at the end of the day its going to out perform stocks and other asset classes so I cant complain.,Yes, thats why Im still holding, presumably these things will happen.I hope at least.,Do you wage slave like me?

Could work out for you if you do free installs and take on all the risk for them. Government offices could be good for this. Tell them youll deliver and stock a vending machine for free, they dont have to do anything. They dont care about the money (they dont keep it), theyre all fat land whales, and their management probably wants one or two around for when people have to work late / skip lunch.,I buy old electronics off eBay, at local thrift stores and at flea markets and fix them for resale. Especially old cassette recorders are easy to fix (you usually just have to replace the belts) and working ones cost like 3x as much as broken ones. I also do reel-to-reel machines, VCRs, turntables, iPods, laptops and a variety of other things. Usually only requires basic trouble shooting and soldering skills to fix. Sometimes I fail and have to sell the thing still broken, but most of the time I make quite a bit of money.,Vending is great when it goes smoothly.Big part of it is you have to be responsive if the business calls in wanting you to fix or clean the machine after a kid rubs an ice cream cone on it.

But its also objectively better than Texas Instruments in every way possible.,More like Jewish Instruments,I own a Casio, great business model, pretty much any highschooler that wants to go STEM has to buy one of these even though Ive ironically used it very little in college. This results in pretty stable yearly profits with no particular reason to compete against other manufacturers.Both Casio and TI could be undercut, but market penetration would be a problem when these two have been the biggest players for decades.,Why does no one go HP?,$120The cost to manufacture these things is maybe 3 bucks.A $120 chink-phone with an algebra-app can run circles around these antiquated shitboxes with their smegmatastic pixelsoup displays.,Thanks, you just reminded me of the asshole in high school who  borrowed  mine and never returned it.

Costs about $16.Something thats annoyed me for a couple of decades is that they never added things like constants to calculators. If youre doing any kind of science or engineering, youll inevitably need to use times / dates in calculations but still have to do the whole, weeks to days to hours to minutes to seconds stuff manually. There are also numerous constants and unit conversions that show up all the times, atomic masses, force constants, pressure conversions etc. It shouldnt be too difficult to add those to a calculator because the definitions are rather simple; just single numbers.I messaged Casio about this just recently and they said theyd mentioned it to their product development team in Japan. Hopefully it becomes available at some point and I might buy one if its integrated into the normal LCD ones, but it would have been seriously useful at school / uni. Theres also zero point trying to remember all those since theyre provided in exams and youd just look them up in work anyway; even if only to double check them.It would also be nice if you could build a simple CSV file with them, so you can record results, store it then open it on the computer to work on the results.,constantsbuilding a CSV fileHow about using a computer?,Cant easily carry a computer around with me. And, despite all the conversion sites online, theyre still annoying to find / use for the correct conversion. Itd be way faster   easier if I could just hit  this many week and days  and have it dump the value in seconds into the formula.,Smartphones are computers and they have conversion apps.,Which app specifically?,I know.A calculator is also a computer. A phone is also a radio.I have used many apps. Theyre not great.I may also not want to be whipping my phone out every five seconds in places were it could get easily damaged or caked with something; like blood samples. I also dont want to have wait while the asshole updates or loads some more ads.,Because they suffer the same issue that modern college suffers. Big government is footing the bill for college and the supplies for it, so companies like this, will continue to up the price of thier product because rubes will continue to take out bigger and bigger federal loans to pay for their equipment.

You can also program it in assembly.,. Theyve become standard everywhere. All textbooks etc are written with the idea in mind that you have a calculator that works similarly.2.

It later increased to 25p before lowering to 20p. The price has continued to fluctuate, reflecting the volatility of the underlying commodity prices. At the time of the original 5p price rise, the company who owns Space Raiders are known as KP Snacks.[4]In October 2010 Space Raiders were relaunched in a new foil pack. These new packs were intended to increase shelf standout. The ingredients were also changed. A new Saucy BBQ flavour variant was also announced. The packs were 20p each.[5]In 2019 the standard bag of Space Raiders was replaced with a new bigger 25g pack with a RRP of 30p. The price marked packs feature a NEW BIGGER PACK! banner.[6] ,this is now a /chinkshitgeneral/ thread,who here has played space invaders that comes factory installed on newer agilent HPLC control panels?,blockboy, phoenix, falldown/thread,Think about it, the only reason why they are profitable is because children in school all over the world have to buy one.

TLDR: It seems that cefi platforms work together very closely, they lend each other Link and use multiple layers of different of wallets/contracts to cover up their tracks. Why would they do this? It shows that Link is being borrowed, just not through Aave because Aave borrowings are all out in the open.,you think they are shorting it or they are expecting a pump?,The last time they did this they shorted because they accumulated just before the big dump to 15$ (May 23 and June 22).

Its not about self-shilling, but the whale has pre-booked add space and seriously needs some people to participate in the competition to get the best possible banner.Our TG group has some artists who will participate, but we need your support anons!Thanks in advance!,fuck adrian, fuck reborn and fuck josh,In the top 300 holders now.My goal is top 100 by next week.,If everybody keeps selling that will be possible.,Josh is cool,thats would be great, such a cheap entry price isnt too often available - think some FUDers really grinded the mood of some anons here to achieve it.,Well… clearly a rug pull scam, but… shib also did insane gains. Ima put 1k in for the fuck of it.,,no one gives a shit about the FUDers, its the whales who own most of the supply killing any and all momentum out of sheer greed,This coin is going nowhere. There is no DMS, there is no conspiracy, that schizo tier bullshit is what caused everybody to take a massive step back from this shit. Fucking schizo /pol/ subhuman trogs ruined this coin; if you werent an air drop or bought day 1 and sold at 0.06c you LOST. Face it, you werent meant to make it. None of you were. You are fucking cattle, cattle has no right.,someones simulating their monthlies i see,Thats not true.Anons own more than whales and its anons that have been dumping us to lower lows the past days.Trying to jump onto the MM train.Pisses me off really.,nice,I hope you read the analysis provided before, its the opposite of hopeless I dont think this is something for sissys and needs patience + consistency. whining around isnt helping. you cant change the whales with this behavior, but you can change your attitude how you deal or not deal with it. whining is just draining your and others energy.the whales just aiming for short-term ROI extinct step by step and the available tokens are burned with every transaction or sold to people with big trust in the whole operation and no paper hands.,let them dump it, every buy and sell is another 19% of that stack burned.,based $WHACKED and Buc-ees enthusiast,word! Im the same,Fuck off Josh,Please keep Fudding so I can buy for cheap,It is only the buyer who has 10% shaved off,false, both buy and sell.look for yourself,The seller sells to the buyer… this is one transaction. It’s 10% that’s shaved off of this transaction, not 19%…???,there is no buyer for every seller though, it goes back into the pool,you sell to the pool or buy from the poolboth actions shave 10%10% of 100 is 10, you get 90sell 90, 10% of 90 is 9you lose 19% of the original,thats implying theres only 100 whackd remaining which is not the case,To answer the question in the previous thread, hell ya Im in for the banner contest.,if you buy 100 whackd, when you sell you will get 81 whackd worth of $,btw did you make the Adrian nft yet?,How long would y’all estimate it’ll take before we get to more than 50% supply burned?, whackd after or before burn?,checked I understand this now you are correct.,hell yeah!,I still don’t think this is correct though. If you buy $100 worth, you get $90 worth, but when you sell it you still get $90, but it is only the buyer that gets $81 worth. It’s burned from the buyer, not the seller.,y’allKys,but when you sell it you still get $90go look at a sell order txgo calculate what they sold and how much $ they got for itthen look at the listed price they sold atspoiler its 10% lower than it should be if you were correct,cant mathcant readcant logicjust test it anon. do a full cycle and see what you get,when you sell or buy it doesnt necessarily go to the next person, only the pool. If you sell and still get the $90 but just 10% of your tokens get burnt, its still the same as what he said because your total amount of tokens are brunt 10% when you sell too. So when you sell buy or send whackd, 10% of that amount is burned. its not 20% of the total amount of tokens you bought when you buy / sell its 10% of the amount of tokens that are burnt,$MOON $MISSION $LAUNCH,you missed the part where the devs are known scammers, own multiple wallets + many airdrop airdrop wallets themselves and are moving it around to obfuscate and then dumping. To be clear it isnt whining - its fact. Learn to differentiate.,Ligma balls,,for new freindsbecause of the 19% cut to your whackd you only make money when the price goes up 19% from your in pointbut your original buy has more preasure up than your sell has moving downas long as liquidity is the sameso yeah, once the people who put nothing in are out, the buy pressure MUST be greater IF there are new buyers,McAfinu reporting,this,I don’t get it,where have you been?! youre late!,Kys nigger,Please dont make it some schizo shit that looks like a scam.

Everyone is a genius in a bullrun. If you want to survive in the shitcoin world, you have to know this:every shitcoin has one - MAYBE 2 - pumps. They go up, crash and never recover.you get in early and sell on the way up or you save your money until you CAN get in early and sell in the way upYou can ignore this if you want and maybe get lucky and get rich... but the odds are that youll just go broke. Play the lottery instead.,I bought at .007 and feel like pretty soon it’ll fall below that at this pace. There hasn’t been a sustainable pump in a while now,I dont get everything about this but i can explain the basis of what is happening:Coin is not new (released in 2019)A lot of niggers got their airdrops at launch and left their bags rotting for yearsFast forward to Johns dead, coin surges againCoin starts to pump/Biz/ sees an opportunity and start to buyReporint McAffinuRotting bag nigs sell like hungry faggots because it is a profitable opportunity now (cant blame them)Some hungry whales do it too/Biz/ fights the sellers by slurping dips and shilling the coinNiggaheadsGetting new buyers is important because they will replace the sellers that dont see much value hereWe crab like madmenTheres no clear project about this coin so the fud gets strongerSome anons lose hope, some just hold and waitLets wait and see,Nothing ever happens.,Bro you are going to make it, just be careful, the clown world doesnt forgive anyone, ride it.,was july 15/ cypris confirmed LARP?,phantomparasitepresentmomentsattaininsteadlivingcontrolfuturethoughtknowledgememory,keep increasing and increasing slippage and nothing worksfuck this coin,Yeah,Looking at this GIF I had a vision for a remastering of how WHACKD is presented.

Only heard about it today. Any reason to think it will still climb? The chart looks like it may be over, or at least a lot of fomo.Isnt that people chasing the top though? Dont they say you shouldnt chase a top?Like maybe if you were already in a week or so ago, congrats you got lucky, but otherwise wont it just deflate at this point with such a big pump?Also, at $200 a coin its not like many people can buy a ton, how much return are they actually expecting?I just figured Id missed it and never heard about it, so no reason to chase., dollar make you holla!,not like many people can buy a toncoin unit value is meaningless,A crucial date is less than 10 days away. Most likely nothing will happen but it should be a psychological turning point where we can start building the coin instad of waiting for John or whoever to save it. Stay positive, eventually WAGMI.,we are early as fuck look at this shit,MM somehow managed to have momentum.

Seeing MM pissed me off, but then i realized yes, whackd can easily get to a dollar if this shit gets to 200$MM gave me hope now all we need is for the whackd devs to suck a fat cock or get pretty much emptied out before a nice rally,Thanks anon,You think theres a chance this coin is his will? That this DMS idea isnt nefarious just him rewarding his holders and people who believed in him? His legacy distributed to people who hold the coin?,We need a video. Normies love videos.

They generate me $20+ everyday, plus the appreciation of the MOMOs ( thats what they are called ), which i paid $1400 but their price went up almost 2x already. This is without playing their game, everything from passive income.These  blockchain games  are the next bubble guys. We had ICO bubbles, DeFi bubbles, NFT bubbles. The next one is gaming. Its been increasing daily, one ir particular already pumped quite a bit (Axie Infinity), but this market is still relatively unknown to the big public. No big youtubers talking about it, reddit is not talking about, biz definitely not talking about it. These crypto games are already showing strength during the bear market. They are not dumping when bitcoin dumps. They are actually increasing in value. Shortly this trend will be obvious and big youtubers will begin to talk about, and from there the hype train starts. Try to get early on this one.I choose to invest mostly in the  Mobox  platform. Their token hasnt pumped yet:https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mobox/Go check now other gaming tokens AXS, DPET, SKILL, etc. The trend is picking up guys. MBOX didnt pump yet and they still have a lot of games to release, plus to get passive income you dont even need to play the game, its attracting lot of users. ( all the games will use MOMOS, but you can invest in the platform just buy buying their token MBOX too, the platform is quite complete as it mixes gaming, DeFi, you can mine MBOX with your MOMOS for passive income, etc, best to go to their website to understand better, they are on BSC for now, the token will for sure be listed in Binance in the near future, but the platform will also go cross-chain later ) Tip if you want to invest in the platform by buying MOMOS : get at least 3 rares ones, which should cost you around $900-$1000, so you can get passive income by mining and join their  adventure mode  once a day ( no need to play, just a few clicks, all passive income ),you stink,What does this mean bros,theyre just ponzis tho right?,axie infinity, theyve been pumping non-stop, a good one too, the most successful so faryes, all of them are, crypto can be addictive on its own, when its mixed with gaming its really something else, thats why its easier for people to hop on those things, hence its growth, the key is to get early,,Cryptokitties all over again,which will 100% outperform the market during the bear,Youre a retard,I would only be interested in making the spites part and selling them on their platform (if its not all done by internal artists) then try to play speculative art curator on cosmetics on a game that might not have a shelf life over 3 months.panic sold my eth at 1880Bears on this board told me bitcoin was going to 24k, I lost 2000$ bros.

The best advice I can give you is to always diversify your investment using $YLA power pool. $YLA power pool give me 12%APY on stable coins and 28% APY on $CVP .

Move your earnings into lower risk passive income sources.,With $YLA power pool you cant lose a cent. Your investment is diversified into different stable coins and hedges you against volatility.

Problem 1. I cant find Wormholes website! It doesnt appear in the Google search result./ Solanas official website does have a page dedicated to Wormhole, great: https://solana.com/wormhole However, the link is nowhere to be found.The page even has a box announcing Wormhole going live. Who announces a product going live without giving users an URL to access it?/ Finally, I was able to find the URL in an old Reddit post: https://wormholebridge.comProblem 2: Wormhole doesnt support $USDC nor $USDT. Only 4 other less used stablecoins are available: TUSD, sUSD, LUSD, BUSD.Whats the logic for not supporting the 2 biggest stablecoins??/ Fine, let me just swap $USDC to one of the 4 supported coins and then transfer through Wormhole.Problem 3: I cant find a way to swap $USDC to those four! Ive heard of three Solana DEXs: Serum, Raydium, and Mercurial. None has a TUSD/sUSD/LUSD/BUSD pair./ Well, Wormhole supports $WETH. Let me swap my $USDC to $WETH and bridge that.Raydium does have an ETH/USDC pair. However, its not clear whether this  ETH  refers to $WETH of unwrapped $ETH.Anyways, I swapped all my USDC to this  ETH ./ I can only guess its the unwrapped one, because Wormhole interface shows I have zero $WETH even though I have just swapped some $ETH on Raydium.Unfortunately, there doesnt seem to be a way to wrap $ETH to $WETH on Solana either./ Last resort: swap the $ETH to $SOL, deposit to Binance, sell for $USDT, and withdraw that to Ethereum.Problem 4: Even though Raydium has both ETH/USDC and SOL/USDC pairs, it cant route ETH directly to SOL. The user needs to do 2 swaps: ETH  USDC then USDC  SOL.Cmon!Please Solana, get your s**t together.Whereas Avax does not have any of this.

Youre not supposed to fill a role in society by sitting in a dead-end job that is necessary but instead constantly be on the lookout for better pay. The idea of the modern labor market is to constantly cycle through jobs to increase paygrades for annual gains in the range of 10% and more. Do it for a a few years and once income is capped for your job title go apply for senior positions and continue doing the same there. In every office oriented line of work you dont have to actually know or do anything, just convince the one hiring you that you are more valuable than others on paper and then the cycle perpetuates forever.

It is one of the biggest traps while getting rich. Unironically the best argument for why to buy and hold.,IF you pay paxes on losses thats your fault,Lets say youswap 50k worth of one coin for another which was up from 1k initial investmentcoin you swapped it for crashes to 1k but you hold it for the rest of the yearrecords show a 50k transaction which is now subject to capital gains for 2021you know owe 15% on 50k of imaginary unrealized gainsyou owe 7.5k on crypto that is only now own 1k worth of crypto It can’t seriously be like this can it?,Yes that is exactly what it is like Wait until you find out about declaring tax when something is received versus 0 cost basis capital gains,receive  income  as lets say SNX in 2020, declare as incomesell for a  loss  in 2021cant carry over more than $3k in losses to 2022Remember Hoang in 2009 the judge set precedent that 0 cost basis is maximum stringency. Use it! Stop paying income tax upon receipt of shitcoins. Declare them at $0 or not until sale.,its called harvesting losses for a reason, OP,And btw eventhough George didnt get Michael Saylors point. Thats what it was. He said declare the minimum someone is willing to pay which is theoretically $0. Even the big boys do it. Make sure you know your taxes. This is a big point to pay in capital gains tax, not income tax.,can you better explain this jewish trick?,Yes.receive shitcointold to declare it as income based on an estimated value, pulled from god knows where, which is Michael Saylors point of declaring it as low as possible, and my point of declaring it not at all until sale or at $0Ok so walk through itdeclare shitcoin at $30 per shitcoin because the value on uniswap says it reached that on the day you got the income from stakinghold for a while before actually selling or using it, in this example hold into the next tax yearNow you just paid taxes on something you never even sold for real cashshitcoin income drops off massively. Move to sell it to cover  income tax . 1. Cant subtract capital gains losses from income tax, even in the same tax year 2. Cant get the money back from the previous tax year for the income tax you paid eventhough you received some random shitcoin worth nothing that someone happened to be willing to pay some massive price for on some random dateHeres the issue for the government. How do they know when a market is sizeable enough to trust the price feed?One more example:i create a shitcoinprovide $0.00000000001 liquidity to uniswap with 1/1 quadrillionth of the supplydrive token to $1trillion per coinairdrop chainlinkgod and vitalik the rest of the supply at that exact momenttechnically now they owe however insanely high a price you chose, lets say a trillion each, such as: dropped them 100 billion coins at $1000 eachOr the more sane way, is they wouldnt pay upon receipt some imaginary income tax from some imaginary price feed, but rather only if they sell it then theyd pay as if the full amount is profit (aka 0 cost basis capital gains). This was the ruling in Hoang vs IRS, the judge ruled that his taxes from 2009 would go in as 0 cost basis because he couldnt prove their source. Meaning he didnt have to pay backtax for the receipt of the assets in income tax PLUS the capital gains from there, he had to pay as if the full amount was 0 cost basis,Also to add to this since it applies to wagies too in a somewhat similarly cucked way of how income tax is basically always the wrong way:receive wages with 30% taken out alreadyOrreceive full wages, invest the 30% at 2%, walk away with more income where you pay it on tax day (similar to upon sale in my previous example, rather than upon receipt),Yeah but let’s say you end up losing those gains, you still owe,One last note, the government realizes this already so they have 12% tax on capital gains in my state versus 6% tax on income, just so youre aware. I still think capital gains is always the way to go. Pay on sale for 0 cost basis.be meforcefully exposed to reddit memes all day via snapchat groups with my normie friendssufferdoes anyone else know about this retarded  family lion king  meme or whatever the fuck? theres another one too now that ive been seeing its like some word that starts with an N and no its not niggerneither of these memes make any fucking sense its like reddit is full on idiocracy,via snapchat groupsKysBUY HEX,Checked,HEX is OK but not really a coin to hold long, but you can as well check BXX of Baanx Ltd, a platform offering free interest loan to stakers, join us as we trade live:https://www.mexc.io/exchange/BXX_USDT,based,Hows your bitcoin doing everyone? feeling good?,lol,Who has balls to hold after this run?,people who are staked for 15 years,in order not to worry about anything, anon, u need not hold gems, but VCEgg . you purchase for the whole balance and sit looking at the growing deposit - gl hfConvince me thatA: Monero is completely untraceable and privateB: Monero is traceable and not private,completelyNo if you really try you can fuck it up.But its 99.999% A and almost not B at all.,Unless you use a tor browser, youre pretty much fucked.,,Not even tracing companies can trace it. They just lie about it.,Why fucked? Eavesdroppers cant even know which IP made the transaction, thanks to Dandelion++.,In so fairness isnt IP address generally pretty hard to get even if youre using a surveillance coin like BTC?,Discreets whitepaper doesnt make sense, its founders doesnt seem to show theyre remotely related to discreet, and worse of all tries to piggyback the success of monero while not even knowing how the features of your  coin  would work,The extent of which monero is not private is only if you bought them from a KYC exchange, the exchange would know that you bought a [Known Amount] of XMR on a certain date for a certain price with fiat.Cmiiw,whats the point if all the reasonable ways to get it are kyc,Assuming its untraceable you can just say you spent all of it commissioning furry porn and theres zero way to prove that you didnt. If they get enough evidence of some kind of criminal activity that they have a warrant to see the furry porn, youre already fucked because of something else, not the coin.Besides, there are non KYC ways to get XMR.,Thats why atomic swaps will be big once they come around. Anyways you shouldnt buy XMR directly off an exchange (If youre concerned about exchanges knowing you have XMR), most people swap it with other alts, use localmonero, or mine them themselves.But the actual privacy features when you use XMR to transact are all tried and true. Its so true that they have people shilling this shit for free based on their beliefs for the coin. Its only challenge is that the developers have to constantly innovate and improve monero if they wish to keep that number one privacy coin spot.,The point is that Monero even takes care of these details, its private from all angles. In BTC whoever broadcasts the transaction first will probably be the sender or know its details. In Monero your IP is safe even if you are not using Tor or a VPN.In the stem phase, every few minutes, the sending node randomly chooses two peers out of all of the nodes it’s connected to. When the sending node sends a transaction, either on behalf of itself or just forwarding the transaction from another node in the stem phase, it randomly chooses one of these two selected peers and sends the transaction to it.The fluff phase is when a node receives a transaction and broadcasts it to every outgoing connection, rather than just to one randomly chosen one, this allows true transaction propagation. Every few minutes a node defines itself as one that will either propagate via stem or via fluff at random, so a stem phase can be quite long if each connecting node has defined itself as a stem node, but once the transaction hits the fluff phase, it stays there.This means that an attacker will not be able to simply listen for the direction of a transaction anymore, because before it was propagated to everyone, it underwent the stem phase, and the originating node of the fluff phase is not the node the transaction originated from, and it is unknown how many hops along the stem the transaction underwent.,You can send shit to KuCoin and then buy it there and then send it to a wallet or something. I get some heavy scam vibes from this token though because A) the total amount cant be audited so who the fuck knows if the devs are just Monero printer go brrrrrrrrr. and B) It has a  General  thread on /biz/ which is indicative of a token being a scam, and/or having a concerted marketing campaign.,What does KYC vs. non-KYC matter if the fiat you transfer in electronically leaves a paper trail to your bank account(s)?,You guys need to learn how Bitcoin started. Do you realize an exchange is just a website someone created right? Its not a requirement. And there are p2p exchanges like localmonero.co. Back in the day, Bitcoin OGs used localbitcoins.com to meet other traders. Once you met someone you dont need to use the website anymore.,Dont quote me on this but you can actually find out the exact digits of Monero supply right from the developers, you cant say the same about Bitcoin if Im not mistaken.Anyways DYOR,Supposedly, they cant do anything based on the info that you spent your fiat for something. That something may be monero, but it may not as well be. They cant prove it,The general on /biz/ is a genuine community of monerochads and people that are interested in monero, you should take a look sometime,Crypto is peer-to-peer. You dont need a bank ffs. And even if you use a bank, it wont have a crypto tag. The sender can say its rent, or miscellaneous or whatever. And if you want to keep that fiat private, then dont use a bank. How do you expect a crypto to anonymize your bank transactions?,*knock knock*FBI, Open up anonWe know about your monero. hand it over WTF how did you guys know!?!?!? Your ISP gave us your IP logs, you were mining monero and running a node. O..oh... Why wouldnt this happen?,If you were in legal trouble and, just for an example, Coinbase was selling you XMR, if you bought it on Coinbase and the government had a warrant to see that you spent money on Coinbase to buy something, they could then subpoena Coinbase to ask what you were buying. But that doesnt really matter since, again, if it got to that point Monero is probably the most secure piece of the operation.Theres nothing illegal about Monero. You can buy all you want.,Its not completely untraceable and private, but its by far the best option right now. You could for instance spin up some malicious nodes and perform probabilistic attacks (especially if combined with flooding the protocol with your own fake transactions - costly). You could easily fetch IP addresses and draw some conclusions that way, which could be mitigated by using TOR. However, just because it doesnt provide 100% perfect privacy doesnt mean theres a better alternative anyway just like how TOR isnt perfect for privacy, but the best option there is. If there is a technology that claims to be  better  in any regard, you have to factor in scalability, decentralization, and especially network effect (where the last two usually falls).,Couldnt or wouldnt exchanges collaborate with the authorities to link your bank account and find your purchase?But unless you mine it, you have to buy it from an exchange with money that isnt crypto. Doesnt that defeat the purpose, if it can be traced back by an initial purchase?,monerojeets are somehow more annoying than link and hbar shills together. wish they would all just stay in their telegram channels and stop shitting up this board,Im still not clear on why youre so concerned about the aspect of buying XMR. Theres nothing illegal about that and theres no way to prove what you did with it.,Because running a node and mining crypto isnt illegal?,your retarded and do your own research on the technology. Then you would know why its so untraceable,what is localmonero,You DONT have to buy it from an exchange. Like I said, crypto is peer-to-peer. Just contact a trader and do the trade, no need for a CEX.,B: Monero is traceable and not privateur an idiot,We know about your monero. hand it overI respectfully decline to answer any further questions until accompanied by legal counselTheyre not going to get you to  hand over  the Monero anymore than they could force you to  hand over  cash under your mattress.,sorry glowniggers its all gone already spent it on rainbow dash X fluttershy hyperscat futa inflation pornwhy wouldnt this work?,You can know the supply by adding up the coinbase rewards for miners, which are the only transactions whose amount isnt private.,monero.supplyDYOR before making retarded claims, not surprising coming from a nazi brainlet,You declared all the monero you mined and purchased in your taxes, right anon?,The law and legal process will protect me!How long do you think that will last?

If you buy BTC for instance, the transactions after a withdrawal would be traceable and easily linked to your name, which is not the case with XMR. Sure its not ideal for avoiding taxes, but neither is any other crypto. Its weird how people try to attack Monero from a problem that really isnt realistically solvable (atleast not with a simple protocol). You could try to get it P2P, otherwise if youre using an exchange that requires KYC, youre fucked either way, albeit less fucked by using Monero.,What monero? ;) Do you have any proof that I mined or bought? Or just that *someone* did it? And I dont live in a retarded country where the Gestapo will hunt you down just for moving crypto from a to b.,Your posting with a VPN, right anon?

Case dismissed.,sorry, officers! my computer caught malware and started mining monero.is it really banned there or are they simply not allowed to buy them on cexes?,do you have any idea how computers work?,Were talking about a not-so-hypothetical near future dystopia.Okay. So Monero *might* not be safe in a hypothetical future dystopia where the government has committed the manpower and resources to tracking down every last monero user and can/will cut through your VPN and send a SWAT team to your house with copies of your shitposts on 4chan to do it.Is...is that your only complaint?,I dont know where these scared amerifags get the impression that crypto is illegal. We promote Monero because we think privacy is a human right, and we dont want anyone who sends or receives money to/from you to be able to see other transactions of yours. Imagine anyone sending/receiving a bank transfer to/from you being able to see your balance, lmao.,Very simple question: Are you White?,we know its not completely private, with certainty. thats all.and thus, monero has a two tier system. clean coins generated from mining rewards, just like bitcoin, and then dirty coins not generated from mining rewards. only on bitcoin some of those non-coinbase outputs are considered clean, while on monero theyre all considered tainted.,Monero becomes  the next bitcoin youll definitely never have to worry about this., (checked)Im only relpying to this bait thread because of those digits.Anyway. 1 BTC! = 1BTCBecause every transaction is known to everyone, any BTC that was tainted with being associated with crime will automatically be blacklisted from most CEXs. Because of this BTC and other coins will never be money. Imagine, if you will, a world where any dollar that has even a particle of cocaine on it is automatically blacklisted from the banks. 1 USD != 1 USD and ergo not be considered money.Because of Monero (ticker: XMR)s privacy features 1 XMR = 1 XMR wether it was used to buy the services of a lady of the night or used to donate to charity. Like real cash it is completely fungible.Look up any of the FUD the trannies love to spread here and you will see there is always an * when they say they made XMR traceable. That * is they have with 46% confidence that address X is person Y. Every. Single. Time.NPCs and kikes cant deny that XMR is digital money and actually fullfills Satoshis vision for a true P2P cryptocurrency that the government fears.,Just assume that every electronic device has been backdoored,What do you gain from claiming  all coins are tainted ?

I dont see any advantage in re-paying it now, what am I missing?,Most debt is not tax-deductible, this include interest on the debt. so you have to pay taxes of your income and then pay off on your debt, meaning your tax rate is de-facto your interest rate on your interests, if that makes sense.it makes more sense to limit your fixed expenditures even if it is at the expense of your income, because it is a guaranteed return of investment.having a lower income also means your overall tax burden decrease, because of progressive taxations.,I would if the fucking boomers would let me,go eat your fucking beans, boomtard,I will Dave.

I have some unallocated cash in my retirement account, but I also have enough to get by for a couple months. Do I take %10 to cash into PMs, dump it into miners, or last thing I was considering is PSLV. How seriously do you all take the threat of withdrawal and liquidity lockdowns? Miners might go to 1000x, but if i cant reallocate into end game goods before the ratios are less favorable again it does me no good.For example, I can buy a property in japan for ~4k, skip somewhere to quarentine for two weeks, and ride this shit out in the land of the rising sun.

For you it all depends about the size of your wealth and your location, and stack food, it could be more valuable than silver in the first time.,Yeah, I think I have my minimum bases covered. Survival and even passive income will be a walk in the park for me in all but an absolute mad max scenario, which if I was going to plan on at all Ill be bugging out to japan first. I am wholly invested in the fiat crash, and in an ideal scenario we have a light crash where assets moon and if fiat is hard to come by my stacks nominal value should ride me through while my portfolio blooms into a make it stack of miners. Then the middle of the road crash would see so much volatility that actualizing miner profits will become a crapshoot and clearing times enough to eat your realized gains before you can tap them, in which case the instant fungibility of metals would be the only reliable make it tool.My food stores are actually quite low come to think of it. Enough to get buy until crops bear fruit is somewhat undermined if I need to survive a winter first. Even without a full mad maxx food prices very well could liquidate people before the airdrops can even be mobilized...Listening to my own musings tho, it almost sounds best to use half my liquid cash to fomo into miners when the market opens and the other half buy metal.,Im a poorfag and i just copped a literal gram of gold and platinum from the apmex jews.Does that anon that sell commie/nazi coins is legit?How long does he take to deliver?,Would YOU buy one?,Shoulda gone with straight 2.5g of gold, tbhfamsenpai.

The funds ringfenced for buy and burn dramatically increases the Rf without hindering Rp making it extremely attractive as investment. Potential upsides are hard to quantify but asymmetrical R/R profile of DxSale is pretty unique in the crypto landscape at the moment. Its a strong buy.,Presales of new tokens never stopped popping out - on the contrary, we had many crazes (ever- ones, doge- ones etc) and tons of copycats.

Retail owns the float. Sherman has acknowledged the support by the shareholders and their involvement in the growth of the company. On June 9th (earnings), all ETFs have been tanked to reduce the price of GameStop.b. This is done by shorting the ETF and going long on all other companies in that ETF.Most importantly.

I know swingies get the rope so hence half the stack. Cohen could avoid me selling to hedge funds, which a lot of people right now are getting a bit pissed off at the complete radio silence from Cohen. Sloganeering like  buckle up  and  power to the players  means nothing when we have supported the company for 6 months and $2bn warchest. Im getting rather bitter about this deal, cohen is a jewish gremlin and my patience is wearing thin. Make a fucking move you fucking cuck.

Still doesnt change the fucking situation does it? Wheres my fucking money?,It couldve happened with any company really.What were seeing with all this is a concept I once called Luciferian capitalism in an argument with a communist friend (While discussing simulation theory and how wed have a moral obligation to cast down any god that created this world intentionally to be the way it is)Basically; the capitalist system is so chaotic, so disorganized and power so dispersed across different fronts that no single group can, no matter how hard they try, gain complete hedgemonic control.As such all it takes when a group tries to do that is for them to fuck up once, to leave a single gap or make a single mistake and that allows people below them to rise up.In other, more centralized systems you have only a small, elite group that needs to be bribed or controlled in order to take the entire thing in hand.Capitalism though? No one knows what the fuck is going on or whos doing what and no one has enough eyes to keep them on everything at all times so theres room for revolutions to grow and enough gaps in the surveillance that the Masters dont see it coming until it hits them right in the throat.,If the most you can do is 6 months than Im sorry, but youre high time preference.,Kinda feeling this.,Somewhere like Bemuda or Greece saying fuck it and rehauling their entire financial system leading to others jumping in.On Africta/South American countries are bold enough to try this and you see what happens when they do.

I dont give 2 fucks about reddit DD and all this shit anymore. Sentiment of normies is waining and my patience is wearing thin for being used as a personal piggy bank for gamestop while I bleed money from my (still in profit) portfolio. The point all you edgy contrarian seem to miss is not EVERYONE is like reddit and cultish or like here and just a venomous edge lord. Most people will now after today begin to sell bits of positions because all the dates have lead to nothing. To them Cohen has no plan. We can sit with bags til it goes to 0, fine.

Unlike everyone else apparently Im the only one here who still only gives a fuck about fundamentals as far as they mean that Gamestop cant go bankrupt. As soon as that threshold hit, and the only other legal way out of this mess for SHF that wasnt retail selling closed for good, I have been completely fucking golden when it comes to moves that Gamestop intends to make. They did all that I need them to do by securing their existence and a future for Gamestop employees. I disagree completely that Reddit needs some sort of information to go off of to stay invested. They spent months before 6/9 hyping up the idea of Ryan Cohen becoming seriously embroiled, and its been literally a month and 5 days since then and you think thats long enough silence to shake their resolve? I certainly dont. And Im not remotely concerned about anyone FOMOing in at this point. We had more than the float willing to vote who only represented shares before April fucking 15th of all dates, Id wager 7 out of 10 holders added to their stacks after that date. Keith can vent all he wants but no, he doesnt have a point that matters to anyone here whos been paying attention.,Dump is The Day After Tomorrow,Why would you ever trust stockpicking every again after this?,the idiot with life changing money still refuses to take profit and will live the rest of his life in regretplease just be a LARP,but /gme/ told me it was two weeks???,,Seed,too schizoThe transformation has been going on since 2020.

Right now he has done nothing but keep pumping hype. When I see his plan Ill admit the fundamentals are solid, which so far they look promising.but like all promises they are something to be kept and not some romantic notion in the future. 6 months is 3 months too long and that this should already have happened twice so far. I am venting and I am pissed off but its turning towards Cohen and his stupid cryptic bullshittery which is leading to nothing but hype days where hedgies spend millions to crash the price, which we buy, that does nothing to the price, then gamestop announces so.wthing, which crashes the price, which we buy and does nothing to the price.So you can see that us buying is doing nothing, its all options driven and is waiting on Cohen to make a move seen at the sec and FBI refuse to fo anything or act on blatant fraud, the world is on Cohens shoulders and so far his sloganeering is not helping the cause and is in fact now detrimental to the cause as people expect things from him- myself included - after all this time, buying shares, diluting on us (a tiny amount), there seems to be no love back from them - oh we get a cat shirt or a cheeky meme. In the meantime Im down 75% from my ATH and Cohen still wont say anything. Whats he waiting for legitimately?

Now that theres no feasible way for that to happen, what on Earth is giving you the impression that the window is closing? I do not see what youre seeing, and maybe if I did Id understand better where youre coming from.,Theyre definitely hiring the good shills now. Although  good  means trannies rather than pajeets.,Yes it is instant garlic to fud. The moment I figured that out I knew hedgies were fucked. Somebody either at blackrock or somewhere put this all in motion. They literally left anyone short stranded with no way to cover.

I’m honestly so surprised it doesn’t get brought up at all.,I dont wanna look at it im just staying in the thread,thats baby losses you little nematode, if you cant take a 50% loss exit the thread and the market now,hi warden. youll be able to pay your sister back, dont worry,Kek hopefully they jump ship,Too many for a sub 80 IQ like you I guess.Well it is, no.matter how cultish you might get, so far I have seen nothing that is going to force them to close put their positions, while people are living out their cars holding GME. How long is that sustainable? The window of opportunity to keep retail on the hype train is waining and people are, outside of the echo chambers of reddit and biz, getting angsty.but so many people here dont actually venture outside and talk to people and just have their bias confirmed. I would sneed myself 2 months ago. But Im right. Time is ticking and  brick by brick  doesnt mean shit but another hype post.,The most persuasive theory Ive seen is that Cohen and the board have been meeting with the sec/dtcc and are negotiating certain ways to detonate the incoming bomb.Until negotiations finish, gamestop want to avoid doing anything that would affect the market too severely.Its only a theory, but it adds up in my mind,No its not.Youll know its the day when shill activity is a zero.,Heh i guess the game stops ;),hedgies bungee jumping off their towers without a rope is an activity though,buying 5 more,Frankly Cohen should bully the shit out of them to speed this up by putting out some pipe bombs and threatening to trigger it early.Fuck you, you were going to burn this company to the ground, you dont get to dictate shit.,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,they are probably going to pick a date no one expects and probably start the MOASS Friday after after hours so people dont cant fomo in,Picking up cheapies.,Bearishpattern detectedHead and Shoulders TopHead and Shoulders Topplus the cramer kiss of deathyikes,Alright alright ill waitIm just pissed i could have bought now instead of earlier at 220,i think this as well just find it weird, Cohen hasnt annouced anything and etc.,I wish I had cash left to buy this tasty dip,You really think retarded shills will get the message and stop shilling when it happens? There wont be time to even shut it down. Its happening. TODAY.,So when the CLA start against the DTCC and SEC for manipulation - then they will just open themselves up to discovery and show how they manipulated the stock for 6 months. That would kill the american markets quicker then mossad and 2 planes,k is chump changeSnod,You too mate,GME also in bearish pattern according to Yahoo Finance.,oh no no no, it keeps going down,Good. Dont need bitches with tissue hands that fold right after the first increase trading halt because they dont understand the scope of the play.,Its what those idiot niggers deserve for trying to make a quick buck on a kiked stock. No different than purchasing a bunch of shitcoins and getting rugged, and delaying GMEs inevitable payout.,Morning, lads. Heres some required reading.https://www.ar15.com/forums/general/-/5-749519/?page=1,Bros the rug is being pulled,O MA LAWD WHAT IS GOIN ON???,Im done acoooomulating, gme you can go off now,I just wish he would throw caution to the wind and do it. He has the perfect defense. The short interest was low and he issued 7million shares so that they can cover the remainder. It’s not his fault they did all this Talmudic trickery to hide their shorts in options.,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,I think its fucked either way it was alway faked and manipulated even more so when computers and algos showed up back in the 70s shut it all down and implement blockchain tech for the entire fucking thing,,he finished buying?,So the thrust of your argument for the window closing is that some people are so strapped for cash now that theyll have to consider closing their positions before we have a chance to moon? Thats at least sensible, I can see how that would be a problem if it affected a sizeable enough portion of total holders. That said, anyone still on this after 6 months hasnt been riding the hype train for a long while now. Most events in this day and age get 2 weeks of focused attention, if that, before theyre glossed over, forgotten and buried to bring out the next piece of distraction theater. That were even still focused on this at all, and at this point hundreds of thousands if not millions of other people collectively are, is proof positive that this situation is a glaring exception in regards to the usual rules of attention span. The kind of retail investors that it sounds like youre concerned either will hop off or wont hop on to the hype train at all are not the people that this play hinges on. The people this play hinges on are currently too caught up in a cat fight between their mods, and I have every reason to believe they could keep themselves entertained and on this ride for months and months beyond this just thriving off of what goes on in their community, let alone action with the company or the ticker.,,The final nail in the coffin is this is the price point the majority of the shares were bought since the MSM was the one that pushed this stock to the masses. Trey trades and Matt khors are about to be lynch mobbed,Are you saying that you think it would be bad for gamestop to negotiate with the sec/dtcc because this would get discovered in a class-action lawsuit and, at worst, potentially open gamestop up to legal action or, at best, just leave the entire public completely disillusioned with the concept or a free market?Im not a lawyer but I assume that gamestop has very expensive lawyers. Combine that with the sec being a government body and I would think theyd have legal protection from any lawsuits.As for how the general public would react, well its a bit late for that. These bodies care about retaining power and money. If the moass happened 4 months ago, they wouldve been completely wiped out and potentially the entire us economy with them. Investors losing faith in the market is a considerably better outcome from their point of view.But Im an idiot so who knows?,bought more at 175.00NAISU,HALP,drops down 5$rugpulled..,When the Tranny mods start infighting,Checked,WE ARE FUCKING FINISHED,no bog pls dont initiate dump,ITS OVER,Holy fuck AMC is done. The end of this whole game is coming soon,Get ready :),this, when AMC dies we have the permission to launch,what the fuck even caused all this,didnt SHF hold AMC. maybe theyre getting liquidated and selling position. check out doge coin also. took a dump,Who the fuck keeps selling?,Its all ogre now,RYAN CHOEN IS PLAIN AIDS HE FUCKED US JUST LIKE AARON CHOEN BOTH KIKES AT THIS STAGE FUCKING DUMPED THIS BULLSHIT YOU ALL COMFY DELUDED FUCKS ARE BOTS,Estrogen injected into places it shouldnt have been in the first place.,Doge is up 6 percent, what?,except every single day pass by retailers buys more and citadel dig the hole even deeper I’ll be surprised that they are still wasting time on meeting to try control the damage, they simply don’t have the luxury to do so.,No one, citadel just doing citadel things,Reminder from Fidelity that no one is selling.,its blatantly irrational for it drop more than 20% after they raised over a billion dollars at $226 and the company isnt facing bankruptcy or anything. it screams manipulation. but the stars have aligned for GME so we just need hodl patiently. and as a consolation prize, AMC and dogecoin seem to be fizzling out lmao.,the rod and the ring will strike,subhuman threadyou need to go back,THIS MEANS SHITGOBACK TOREDDIT,its down ~40% on the month,So the guy who said today till the end of the week would be the start, where you at you delusional fucking baggie? Its down to 176. Sure doesnt look like a rise to a MOASS to me.,bottoming out on the rsi, due a pump to desu,It would be bad for those whom are manipulating the stocks. Through legal discovery when millions of dollars are now in the hands of people wanting to expose this then yes the DTCC are ot a government body, they can be sued, gamestop themselves are not manipulating the stock but the SEC can be attacked like the IRS and scientology - sue the personal member ers of the SEC not the organisation. Thats how they got their tax exemption status by suing individual members.These things can all be done without issue when the moass actually happened. Imagine a CLA where everyone e whom has been wronged by Melvin and Robinhood can add themselves to the CLA, now take a small dotl action from everyone involved. The entire stock market is now fucked.Also we are playoff g max pain again. $175 this week and oh look we ste at MP price. How is this not being manipulated by some very senior players right now? This shit is going to play out in courts for years after regardless, these fuckers are going to be sued by newly made millionaires soon enough.,,Shut up fag,Retail isnt sellingTHIS MEANS NOTHINGYOUR LIFE MEANS NOTHING, GO BACK TO THE FUCKING WOMB.,I’ll be surprised that they are still wasting time on meeting to try control the damageWhats this I hear of them trying to hide their burning of the midnight oil from reddit by changing some google settings?Lmao the desperation.,wow youre a faggot,how do u know what the rise to moass would look like retard,,,He had the chart he drew with crayons upside down,Patience brothers, Talmudic trickery knows no bounds, this is a war not a battle. Its time to go dark, leave these threads and just know we all hold together in the darkness.,The other part of my price negotiation I forgot to mention isthe number starts at 6 millionit can only be brought down by presenting me with evidence it wasn’t that high in realityI will summarize their findings and present it to AIPAC on their behalf, implying it is the official position of them and their fundTick, tock, hedgies. Better start covering,anyone still holding any amc?,kek saved,Also, holy shit when did Keith turn in to a fudfag?,Etoro adding leverage to GME is one of the most bullish signs ive ever witnessed.WERE CLOSE FRENS, WAGMI.,i sold at 56 and bought more GME lol,Well everyone on /ss/ keeps talking about the recent rule implementations and how, fundamentally, they serve to protect the clearing houses and the continuation of those bodies.Unless theyre all just wrong in their analysis (super possible) then that is a major indicator that the claim may have truth.SHFs may be fucking themselves over more and more each day, and in turn fucking over various banks etc. But if you look at it as a battle for survival, the dtcc and sec care much more about their own perseverance. So theyll let the economy take a bigger hit if it means they dont get fucked as hard themselves.As for SHFs, I wonder if the dtc has implied to them that they wont be allowed to fail in a bid to keep the charade going a little longer?I mean, we cant know at this point and anyone who claims to is speaking bullshit. But that goes both ways. Even citadel doesnt have the full picture, and I think thats what most DD is missing,Its time to go dark, leave these threads and just know we all hold together in the darkness.lmao no one heres falling for your feeble 1pbtid tricks you dollar store temp,source faggot,emoji-brains, the put option activity in the AMC 30 and 35 strikes seems ominous. Call your boomer parents and get them to buy calls? Dont just stand there; lose something!,When cohen refused to act. His little jewish gremlin face needs a slapping. DO SOMETHING YOU FUCKING KIKE,Fuck you nigger,Ha same I sold at 62,Too long, didn’t sneed,Etoro adding leverage to GMENow why would they do that?Any of you fags ITT use etoro?,Not when they keep making money off retards buy options.,KYS,the DTCC are ot a government body, they can be sued, gamestop themselves are not manipulating the stock but the SEC can be attackedSure.But play it out in a courtroom and youll get 4 hours of nervous-looking men with grey hair explaining how they didnt realise what the damage was and when they did realise, they had to implement *special* measures to protect the entire economy.It always comes back to 2008 and how none of those fucks went to jail even though you can easily find out exactly what illegal shit everyone was doing. All it takes is plausible deniability.Its never just a case of a judge going  yeah, these laws were broken so fuck you  because these guys are way too rich/powerful to deal with that. At least, thats what my inner sceptic says and Id wager that thats what they themselves believe,Good job adding to the cultishness. I got one have SNEEDED and you sound desperate more posters than anyone here. But the fact people sneed ME now for bringing up valid points shows you how you need to step away for a bit.

Amc wasn’t a good play but he’s a piece of shit,Theyve added leverage to everything havent they?,The thing is they will took the blame in the aftermath regardless they survive or not. There’s simply no way around it for a governing body not doing its job and created this mess with SHF. They are doomed to begin with so what’s the motivation behind the delay is become even less clear now.,i do, sold half my shares yesterday losing 750€ and at -800€ today. I also have 60 gme shares so im not that concerned and i can invest that liquidity in more GME now. Still kinda disappointing, not sure if i should sell the other half or hoping for a little comeback,Shorting GME is disabled on etoro,Owning a CFD means NOT owning the shares, basically the asset is in etoros hands.Is that all etoro deals in?

IMO the normies got burned so hard this round that were not going to see another bull run for many years in crypto. between vitalik on shiba, etc, and elon on doge, you probably had at-least 5 million normie investors lose ~70-90% of their money in the last few months. thats a lot of free FUD available whenever crypto tries to pump.,That doge incident wasnt a bullrun, it was straight up hysterical hype, which led to a massive overvaluation of crypto. we are still so damn early, and the way i see this, is that crypto is going to play a massive role in digitalization in the upcoming decades. we will never not have the technology of decentralized networks anymore. Normies who buy doge and shiba wont understand this and dont even care, be glad they are out for now.,uniswap is one of my favorite exchange, and BXX might still be listed there with time, but we are live on MEXC, join us now, and you might be the lucky winner of our 25,000 BXX token annonhttps://www.mexc.io/exchange/BXX_USDT,https://www.mexc.io/exchange/BXX_USDTFuck off curry nigger i dont want to buy your bag,problem is, as i said, the normies got burned. dont underestimate how much FUD normies will spam for free if its something they feel wronged them. crypto wronged normies. theyll FUD it on every media outlet until the end of time now.,yeah im sure vitalik forced you to buy shitcoins and use uniswap,fuck you,the gas fees are really bad they just wanted $400 in fees to exchange $7.5k over the eth network. fuck outta here with that shit, using coinbase pro was much lower and reasonable,same i dont like paying $29 in gas fees to have transaction fail every 2 out of 3 timesWhen $20?, is fudwhen 200,Im ku.. ku.....

If we dont hear anything by then...I dont know, how could I even worry? Its not like not getting a council member this week means hashgraph technology is invalidated, and Leemon and Mance certainly arent here to do an exit scam or they would have dumped their tokens within months instead of over 15 years.I guess it would be disappointing, and Ill admit the lack of updates is boring, but my faith in Hedera Hashgraph is unwavering.,,Im 67% hbar and hedging with 33% algo.It seems algoy has even worse performance as a homocoin, its litetally a one trick pony(CBDC) but theyre leader-based and community driven which the banks fuckin hate.Im thinking of going more 75% hbar now, but im dumping all my algos if no CBDC announcements in 2 months.Outside of dogecoins(if it ever drops to less than 10 cents) I cant think of any crypto to invest in as a hedge.Quant trannies arent convincing enough and defi trash like eth or cardano has no future, only corporate coins.,watch the new links in the pasta if you havent already, they will cure your boredom fren.

Corps are going to get involved and that’s where most transaction volume will come from. Eth shat itself when it had the sole purpose of being a shitcoin casino.I’m thinking of going into quant heavier now, literally will be the OS of Web 3.0. In an ideal world, Web 3.0 primarily runs off hbar, link, and qnt,cant see link having much future, it just looks like something thats not supposed to make you any money, especially at its current market cap.If dogecoin had a 6b market cap I would be all over that shit in a heartbeat, link, not so much unless it dumps to a fiver.,The real use cases for Link haven’t even started yet. There’s a reason hbar has them on their governing council. They’re pretty instrumental to the start of Web 3.0. Once everything runs on layer 1 DLTs though, the market can likely determine its own price.

Birthday coupons, loyalty rewards...etc. They also give a sense of  owning  something, a sense of exclusivity, compared to a general sale. YOU have the coupon, so YOU get the discount, and not others who missed out on it.Theyre just creating a new standard for coupons and Hedera happens to be a part of the thing that runs under the hood, as with most Hedera usecases.,companies also achieve the same you are special effect by offering a rewards or membership card. e.g. every grocery store. costco even more intelligent, charging consumers for membership, which consequently makes them an even more frequent customer.Theres a reason there are thousands of coupon intermediary startups. they try to solve/alleviate the problems associated with issuing coupons.coupons dont make sense logistically/operationally and have aton of baggage they drag with them. customers pissed when theyre expired or they dont understand the terms. actually need to print/send them out. open to legal loopholes if you write it poorly. pain in the ass for the cashier. pain in the ass for the customer searching for and preparing them. and now the rampant fraud I have never heard about.,Youre deluded if you think the price is going above $1.50 with the current tokenomics in the near term.Klever.io is launching an nft game.

While most have seen NFT’s come and go, im fairly sure this isnt some tulip bubble. After Grimes selling her NFT for millions, instantly being called an NFT fad hype. https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22308075/grimes-nft-6-million-sales-nifty-gateway-warnymphIf you think NFT’s is just about auctioning your digital bathtub duck, then I think you’re been living under a rock. To me this looks more like a new major trend is kicking in. NFT’s are more than a NFT fad.What if NFT’s havent even scratched the bottom of its true potential? Now I am not gonna waste time with just another meme. We’re looking to add things to our portfolio with a potential utility, and obviously market viability.Given I know quite some musicians myself. And the interest they have shown to produce stuff without a middleman, my safe guess is that NFTs could be revolutionary steps to take for musicians. Not only giving them a lot more control over their output and its pricing, but also offering a direct revenue stream between themselves and fans that’s not reliant on third parties such as streaming platforms and concert promoters. Moda is one of those well connected projects I will keep my eyes on.From their Medium “Since 2015, the music industry has been paying close attention to the world of blockchain. We’ve been talking about it at conferences for years. We’ve seen projects rise and fall; some disappearing forever, others making progress in an exciting direction. But in 2021, the Web3 space has advanced in a more rapid way. The time has come for the music industry to come together, embracing what looks less like another industry iteration, but an entire paradigm shift.”And guess which underground kingpin is pushing its shoulders under this?,Deadmau5 in the house, this guy has already quite some NFT expertise under hes belt. Solid advisor for this project,How much of a role do you really think he has in moda? Do you think hell actually promote and pump it?,Dude has 3.4 million followers on twitter,What kind of project launches without a whitpaper? Red flag,No whitepaper, No team... ?,true, hopefully he is willing to tap into that audience in a way that is genuine. I like emanate and this new moda d.a.o., have high hopes they just need to execute with these music partners. it will make all the difference imho,what about this emanate airdrop? read that holders get it but how much, could tank the price,wont be enough to influence price significantly, the requirements were strict,Still in stealth mode my dude but good summary post on their medium. https://moda-dao.medium.com/an-introduction-to-moda-dao-e9a5ac4e8ccd,Sigh more paid shills??,are you surprised?,Dont be quick to judge anon, go read about Moda and Emanate. These guys are the real deal in music NFTs with legit support. This will be a monster for the next bull run.,r we finally admitting the bull run is over? I thought we were still in denial phase hahaha,no it wontbut at least you admit bullrun is done,How to buy??,People become dumb as fuck when they see things on a silver plate.,Yea, but paid shill or not, projects need exposure, and competing with shitcoins gives no other choice than to make your noise louder, regardless the greatness or genuinity, you need to market loud and clear... After reading the Medium article, the project seems promising enough to me, yet I do need to see a whitepaper before I buy in though. Their partnerships on the website also seem decent on first sight.,lol really?? projects are getting lazy huh,Team is based man, 4 years experience in blockchain and 20 years in music. They are working on a whitepaper and lightpaper apparently but probably not best use of their time rn. Dont blame them.,Im bullish as fuck on music NFTs. Its one of the best use cases for this tech and its not hard to understand why. The challenge will be if any of the many NFT projects can get enough traction to become widely used. At least Moda has significant industry backing and experience. My chips are on this one OP.,wen launch?,was in june then july but i guess well see. nobody wants to launch in these conditions,no shit, permabulls are gonna get fucking rekt lol who tf is making money on token sales anymore?,VCs and project teams lol,Do they have any tokenomics out? Need to understand risk and reward,I’ve been saying this forever, every piece of shit thing got the spotlight during the nft craze, except music,would want to know too. You can’t just blindly buy anything these days,Aping into this thx for sharing anon. I was shilled this a few weeks ago as well looks legit and the simps love this shit. Will probably get picked up by some big names and exchanges,you think so? I dunno there was a lot of shit about big names in music releasing NFTs. At least a lot of the artists I follow on Twitter were cashing in.,yawn NFTs are old news boys pack it in. Just load up on some LINK and wait a few years. You can thank me later.,lol check out this fucking retard. NFTs are old news? Fuck anon its only getting started. Too many smooth brains chasing shit coins not looking at the big picture and dont have the patience to see it thru. Good luck with your link bags tho,who hurt you?,will probably ape in too once it launches if it dips. With the music connections it should do well. High hopes for world mobile too which I got shilled here recently. Check that out too anon.,not sure if you were shilled or youre trying to shill us... Im guessing the latter.,Fuck is that deadmau5? Hes been in techno since 30 years,lol look at this boomer shit. Who else do they have?,Richie Hawtin is probably involved with deadmau5, the two of them have been into the NFT scene for a while now,Who tf is richie hawtin and why should I care? Can I make money off this or not anon??,Wait so is the Moda team the same as Emanate? Because the chart and volume for Emanate are fucking terrible lol,They are launch partners apparently but not the same team or product. Also doing a big airdrop for EMT holders. I dont have any EMT and dont plan on getting any for the airdrop. Just gonna scoop up Moda on a post launch dip.Will everyone migrate to optimism now or they going to split liquidity?million bros...,Actually holding well than expected. Somebody wouldve made a lot of money by buying the dips and selling the immediate bounces.,literally put my link stack in at $190,are you the same retard who posted like 1 or 2 days ago bragging about doing an x15 with this?bet you didnt cash out lmaobaghold it to 0,YOU TOLD ME WE WERE GOING TO $500YYYYYYYYYYYEAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHGGGGGGGG,I bet TL will rugpull that fucker. Proper snake oil salesman pitch in his last video.,BROS I THOUGHT THE POINT WAS TO GO TO A MILLION!?,AHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH,at least you arent this guy, send 450k from binance, put it all on MM at $195, hes now worth 270khttps://etherscan.io/address/0x9ba91ce6a54750aa7f13c98a2384c03227817f04#tokentxns,do i just sell at this point lol,Everyone who bought after $100 and didnt sell at $200 is unironically a retarded gambler who deserves these heavy bags.,Why would anyone buy this coin? Is it some sort of fin dom fetish or something? Why would you bag hold for an e-celeb millionaire? Is it like a cuckold thing?,FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKK I HAVE LOST SOO MUCH FUCKING MONEOS,No I thought I was finally gonna make it big this time…..FUCK,I have zero sympathy for anyone that is going to lose their money on this shit despite MILLIONS of warning,I mean, I still regret not getting in on this at 1 or even 10 dollars, but after a more than 3x pump in a day going to 200x from the initial price, you have to be crazy to not cash out.You can always buy back in with your profits later, but its delusional to think a LITERALLY USELESS shitcoin wont dump at that point.,make sure to hold all the way down to $10,Make it by donating your money to a millionaire youtuber? This was the most obvious pump and dump in history.,Id rather buy INTERNET COMPUTER,Millions of bag holders have been born today,You stupid fuck,yes... thanks for that btw. whatever. i am demoralized anyway, nothing matters anymore.,I guess hell laugh in the end. I would have gladly sold for $200 and taken the swing, but then Id have to pay taxes on my yearly income and health insurance and also take cutbacks in payments.Gosh this is stress for me. I really dont know why so many people in the crypto space generally suggest DCA/Hodling. For me, swinging is much easier, taking profits where possible and being at ease on non-indicative markets.I was the guy that in the last thread warned entrants that a drop to 100-80k would be possible.,,Replace 100-80k to $100-80,I SMELL COPIUm,Im glad to not have fomod into this yesterday.,How the fuck was I supposed to know that asshole? Where the fuck were you when I was buying? Shit is so unfair,And wallah, the moon mission resumes,CopiumYou were saying?,when did you buy? If youre buying something AFTER it has done a 200x in a couple weeks you should probably realise youre the one holding someone elses bags,Yep, youre 72% down from your all time high, and its gonna keep dropping,,Youre 72% downLooks like youre the one coping. I just said buy the dips and sell the bounces. More than 50% return for catching that knife at $90.,No, he said he would shill it to 100,For now im glad i stayed strong, the fomo i was feeling yesterday as it hit 100 was insane.,Its back at $150, start feeling the fomo agaon.,Millions of bagholders were created today and you two are stuck shilling this falling anvil.,Good, you deserve it.,Falling anvil bouncesHoly copium,its recovering,Are you guys ready for this board to be flooded with threads shilling large numbers scamcoins on bsc?,Of course it is after such a huge drop. The shakeout was useful, even if on didnt realize the profits from the swing. It helped to get some people out who were about to pull their trigger on 20x+ profits anyway.,These degenerates are going to bring heavier and heavier regulation to the crypto space.,Theres already Thousand, Trillion, Billion, Quadrillion...,Kek,Dont only do research on /biz/ and Youtube, retard. If you cant understand the coin or it has no function on the blockchain, dont fucking buy.,Good. Being forced to register to some kind of governmental organism with your real life details and all the bureaucracy behind it will deter jeets from using crypto ever again.,The  I told you so  cope of fundamentalists makes me vomit. It seems that your research is finished but you still have a lot to chew on and finally feel entitled after a drop. You are like vegetarians who have to shove it in everyones face. Market is diverse, you do yours and youre neither more correct nor entitled.,Well it is pretty funny to me that even with a coun this fucking simple people still dont grasp the fundamentals. Like theres no staking, no yield, no pools, no swap, no promises of any of this, just a million tokens with at least a million bucks liquidity. The rest is markets. Just apes being apes. Shit will run its course.,I mean what did you think was going to happen retard,bought at $2.50sold it at $3.50 be honest, will I ever make it?,Everyone itt is gonna fomo in at 300 in a couple of hours,I just want coins like this to die,I mean how high can it go guys, its just another shitcoin with zero inherent value, r-right?haha,Yes,I just take a bite of the situation as it comes and am where I can make quick profits with bets. The best technical coins are best to go long from a low, technically weak coins are best to short on a high. With coins like this one it purely depends on being early, swinging rather than going long if necessary, bullish rather than bearish. Fundamentals, purpose would all just make me emotional in trades where I try to be sober.The coin here has 0 utility and still a lot of potential. Cope in a bear trap is still cope. But to make people feel uncomfortable so they will realize losses sucks or is intentional.,And to clarify, Im rather a bear than a bull and have even suggested a high downward risk at $200 in the last thread. All because I tried to be sober.,he didnt check the priceIts back to over $175.,How did people even find out about this?,Its a telegram group that bought into million token with different addresses between $10 and $20 trading it back and forth, once they see a bunch of buy transactions that arent theirs they go into to dump mode dumping on the outsiders to scare them into selling.Once the selling is done they start wash trading it back up to lure in more suckers.,,I was asleep,Theres already a couple of them.God I hate this board.,Like on every coin. Learn to deal with it. Here you can even glimpse at liquidity pools.The price action was to be expected not only because of people in high profits but also because of Bitcoin. Telegram groups on coins dont make much difference. Learn Wyckoff thoroughly and not just the 1 minute glance of a few patterns.,This is insane :( I’m never going to make it cause I’m not aware of stupid things going up,FUCK I WAS PANIC SOLD AND HAVE TO FOMO BACK IN.I LOST SO MUCH MONEY FUCK THIS CLOWN WORLD,god i hate moneyfixed,,he sold,because everyone who tried to swing bitcoin lost to DCA people,Dont be eager. The risk of loss is your first priority, minimize this, profit then comes secondary. Get aware whether youre very familiar with a coin, correlation, similar coins. Double-check your intention before the action. Check what arguments you can find against your intend. In a last step before the action, check whether youd be okay with losing your bet.If you pay attention to all this youll worry early and be early enough to then rest when its dangerous as other people are worrying.everyoneWith this, your statement can only be wrong, regardless of the substance. Yes, many make more profit with DCA, but the many with more profit correlate substantially also with early adopters, people with more capital, people with easy positions because of their situation. If everyone just does DCA in a cycle that continues its fashion, the big chunk of the pie goes to this exact group. Could almost replace generation contracts in terms of pensions.However, the crypto pie will be eaten up as more and more people cut out their profits. With diminishing returns and lengthening cycles, the profit is in the change, not in the growth, despite underlying inflation.,FUCKING FINALLYI hope this piece of shit crashes to zero. This and all the rest of the scamcoins taking value away from the good stuff. Maybe that faggot nip will go to jail and commit sudoku too, that would be nice.,It’s almost fully recovered,Americans who sold before sleeping are waking up and are fomoing back in,Jesus christ, youre right. The retardation will keep going for a while, I guess.,No fucken way.,I believeI believe in Techleads visionI will follow Techlead into battleI will become a milLIONnaireThat is all,Did you buy the dip, anon? You do want to make it, right?,WHY FID U FAGGOTS TELL ME NOT TO BUY. I could have 2x in a hr but you faggots called it a scam NOW ITS BACK OVER $200,Trillion trillion (TT) launched yesterday and has $300k in liquidity https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0xc03ac1e9c6946fed9e36732cebbcd73b0c7a0637,I mean you could have. But if it went back to 200 in an hour would you have taken profits or held on the way back down hoping for more?,In cont of Please dont take me as if perma trading is the big deal. Trading should really be left to the days when you find confidence, even if it is only a 2-3 day period in 3 months. And Im not against averaged orders either. DCA is great before a possible bull run when you dont know if you are on a top, relying on a general bullish sentiment. Averaged selling, on the other hand, is good when you cant time a decline but feel it is likely, as youre approaching the top.As a computer scientist, I have doubts on the technical security of coins. Next, a stock market crash is long overdue and we are nicely filling everything into a bubble. I cant hold money and assets in that thought for long. Think of someone who doesnt want to hold anything or can only enter at high risk. Thats exactly how newbies generally feel. Compare the risk of buying Bitcoin at 32k with the shitcoin you get as an early adopter. I would say risk and potential are both better with shitcoin if you can trust on the marketing and some reputation.,My post was buy the dip sell the bounces. Even if you traded the 2 immediate bounces, You wouldve gotten at least 60%.,i was about to buy 20 of these at 25$, already put the amount on uniswap. then i had no eth for the transaction and out of laziness i couldnt be arsed getting eth. now i look at the price and i feel disgusted,it was marketed LITERALLY (literally) like a pyramid schemewhat did people expect?,I’m tired of investing in shitcoins without any perspective. I was goddamn surprised when I checked the $RICHIE token on a $RICHIE ecosystem. Respect! Support by BSC and FEG, launch of 360 degree web soonWhen they said Summer of Chainlink stupid me assumed that meant it would go up. Now I know they were saying its like going to the beach in the summer and a shark bites off your dick while seagulls peck out your eyes and then you drown. I understand now. my bad,Point to me where they said that because the team literally never hypes so Im afraid until then youre a shill.Crypto doesnt deserve a good project. Literally every Crypto since Bitcoin has massively profited the founders from ETH to Link...all of them. Im talking millions and even billions for some. So what does biz do when a project takes no funding or tokens and actually gives back bitcoin sent to give out the first tokens. I wont even bother trying to prove this is created and funded by Jack Dorsey. But fact is they took no benefit and have worked at pro levels for 3 years. No one can prove this wrong. So what was biz response? Call it a pajeet scam while pump and dumping erc20 dog coins. Does biz really deserve not to be scammed? My opinion is no biz deseves every fucking dump and rugpull they every lost money in..fuck u biz.Memecoins ? Buying them? Me? Sea of red?hehe. sit down kid , dxsalex will tell you a story.Listen. i buy dxsale and get basically indirect dividends of each project and shitcoin that is launched on the platform. Yep , each one. About 20-30 are launched on each day. Platform takes 2% of each token and sells these for profits , we as a token holders get 50% of that profit which in turn is used to buyback and burn the dxsale tokens. We´ve just pamped from 20c to 1 usd in half a month because of this.Best part: There is still about 3 million worth of revenue that is used to buy back n burn tokens. Best part 2: each week , platform generates about 250k worth of revenue from the shitcoins which then again is used for buy back n burn. Endless buy pressure and no one wants to sell the tokens because it´s only gonna go up. Best part 3: Rest of the shitty market has no effect on the token , btc can go to 10k and this shit will still pamp.So unironically , buy dxsale , get profits of each shitcoin launched on the platform , enjoy the gains. yes it´s that easy.eow 1,5usdeo august 3usdeoy 12-20usdeo 2022 40usd.anyways , this is dxsalex , hope you make it son.,Been off /biz/ and didnt check charts for a month. I come back, BTC is still 32k. What the fuck, when is it going to go anywhere?,Its crab season my negro. Buy low, sell high. 4% profits every two days. Its literally that easy.,This. Its easy moneyfuck wagie fuck mumu,whats your liqu. price,Liquidation price and amount please,Start preparing the noose,almost 36k, got too cocky and kept adding as it went downstill in profit but if the scamwicks are going to continute not sure,Lol I hope your ok bobo.

These early KCC infrastructure buys are the most obvious bet in crypto rn,reminder to filter the terms KCC, KuCoin, KSC, etc,Not with me, Rakesh,ngmi,I was researching AMMs on KCC yesterday and this is my impression of all 4.Kandy has a childish them and the fonts on the site look unprofessionalKuSwaps farming yields didnt match what they saidKoffee had charts which differentiated itself but then KuDex and KuSwap addded themKuDex has a green theme that matches the chain and the Dev team seems to be the best, Not with me, Rakesh,Your loss, I fucking love Kudex,been farming since sunday,pretty good returns desu.dev keeps building so i´m pretty convinced this one can be a winner, we just need some marketing and legit projects. but since the dev doesnt want rug´s on it it could become the first legit dex out there,I a big boner for Kudex. I like things simple and the name, the website and the project are all reaching less into gimmicks.,Hands down the best UI for any swapper on the KCC network. And the farming yields are no joke! My favorite by a long shot.,Kudex is Pancakeswap for like 10 cents :) lucky to be 1 time early :),I chose that farm too just because Kudex only has a $1m marketcap which is a tiny fraction of Koffee and Kuswap. And Kudex could easily end up being better than both of those.,Yeah KUDEX BY FAR THE BEST. GET AWAY FROM KANDYSWAP. TOKEN WAS $10, NOT ONLY WORTH $1 TEAM ARE SCAMMERS!,Holy shit it was like $4-5 only a day or two ago. A slow rug it seems. Koffee is also down like 80%. Koffee really does suck. No farms and their UI was like something a high school beginner threw together.,Smells like a Kudex shill campaign in this thread,with that said it is probably the best of the bunch and the price drop is only because KCS is shitting the bed. Hopefully the KCC doesnt die out of the gate because BTC decided to drop below 28k on the same week the main net released.,Its still early and development is happening rapidly. There could be multiple successful DEXs on KCC.,Wow such organic posts! Totally organic and ebin, bullish for kudex lolFucking scammers, Kudex is a scam, it has been proven several times already.

Maybe the token FUDDing other ones because theyre scared their product is inferior?,What facts did you post? Could you point them out?,I posted 2 facts here already, the first fact is that Kudex is a scam, and the other one is that the tax is insane and only retarded people would fall for it.,kek,kandy has by far the best product, other projects can only FUD because they know they lost the race,You know it.

If the devs are white this will get sent,Just found this token called KuMillion Its a mirror for the MM token in ETH, which we all know how juicy it was, look for it up TG.,are you trying to talk about the profit of shit coins? so outdated lol. check ChihuaToken to be in trend dude,.000093 KCS of liquiditythat was quick kek,fuck sakes Im not even mad that they pulled liq. Im just quite surprised they did it at such a little mcap. Just look at KuSafemoon or KuDoge. So easy to get to 6figure marketcap or higher. Why pull at less than 10k marketcap. Jeets of little vision,Kek ahahahahah,WHY IS IT THAT I ALWAYS RUGGED.,KCC shitcoins are even worse than BSC shitcoins because you cant verify if the contract is clean and the explorer is dogshit. If the BSC was like walking over a tightrope blindfolded, the KCC is like walking over it blindfolded and with your arms and legs tied up. Im just buying utility stuff for now in the hopes they become the next pancakeswap/bogged.,Stop buying scamcoins,Fuck these jeets rugpullers, I lost money with their scam. I made my own KuMillion fork, lets show these dumbasses how its done.0xfA4b99CAF30f01ed6bBdBe63Df22E7E8CDbBD629,Absolutely based,you scumbag this is a honeypot.

Considering making a KuMM myself and locking liq but would only be putting in kcs from my ape wallet. It would be so fucking tainted thanks to these jeets though hahahaFuck you lying jeet kek,Not laziness these dipshits work harder than they would doing a real project and make a fraction of what they could with a fraction of the work.Lack of skills or poor mindset Ill buy. Whatever the answer is without a doubt smooth brained.,Wow, congratulations on your 43¢ anon!!!!,Devs mentioned that theyre working on charts at the moment, poocoin is just a temp solution,This looks to have a better upshot than koffeeand the devs dont have 80% ready to drop.I do get the chart argument though.,I mean its still not a great gain even if you do the math correctly.. but how are you getting 43 cents?About 314.76 KUD = 1 KCS currently1 KCS = $11.36 USD currentlyThen factor in the 1% he lost depositing his liquidity, and 6% lost on the sale.. much higher than 43 cents.What am I missing here?Why is the proof only in TG and not posted elsewhere? You could convince us, but instead you want us to join some terrible TG for the  proof . No thanks, doesnt seem legit to me.I did still throw a couple bucks at KandySwap just in case, before I even saw that High Risk audit. So far Ive gained 0.33 Kandy while the token itself lost 66% if its value.. awesome.,Youre missing your way back to /reddit/ nigger,Big surprise, the guy showing up in every KCC related thread and posting negative comments is also posting his own scam contracts now.. lmao, how predictable.,who needs to post facts when you can just call people out for  reddit spacing  like a newfag and feel satisfiedYou do you I guess..,Holy fuck I didnt even realize it was the Kudex FUDder that posted the scam kek, Id bet money it was the same scammer that launched kudex. org,Probably the scammer that posted the kudex/kutools clone scams Not even smart enough to be original,Scammers gonna hate while based apes keep stacking Kudex,same lol I didnt know I was in for dex wars, this shit is greatKoffee and Kudex are the only two worth a shit and Koffee is going down,Was anyone in the kuCHAD telegram?,what happened?,lmao another scam?probably the same scammer behind the kDEGEN one, same modus operandi: first an airdrop then a shady whitelist pre sale (no dxsale)lame, I was expecting the aridrop to be worth something (again),Kudex swap down for anyone?,Pretty sure they just rugged, their whitesale was today and their telegram no longer exists kek this place is like the fucking Wild West right nowWorking for me, you scared the shit out of me,The site is up Swap getting dns errors over here,went down for about 5 minutes for me but no problems after that, some people are still having issues,btw how much will kcs dump :((,Kudex getting DDOSed apparently lol, bullish(?),Working now ... still jumpy with KCS all around soooooo many rugs/honeypotsThis has been the most stable so far and I have hope for it.,im cautiously optimistici know a bit more than most and im feeling bullish i sat back and watched to see how things wentjust trying to pull out my initial and let it ride, i think if dev was gonna rug he wouldve done it already,Meh already pulled the orginal out and a quick 20x and Im still bullish as well. The dev seems wise enough to know there is more money in letting the project ride than rugging.,thats exactly what it isthe competition is shitit really comes down to kcs and the crypto market as a wholeif the bull market just started up right now, this shit would pop,I just hope they get better ddos protection, server going down on swap end is rough,i thought it rugged kek,I did for a minute It just looks so much better than the comp I would be disappointed if it did,checkeddev doesnt sleep btw, hes crazy enough to make this legitthink it just comes down to the market,NiceIts just odd not seeing it shilled anywhere but bizI hate to say it be we need reddit normies to make it really pop,as far as i can tell this growth is pretty naturalAnd honestly I think its gonna come down to the product speaking for itself. Kudex will start stealing some market shares. Hell, its been near the top in volume on kcc over and over. This might just be my yolo play. Which means it will probably rug. The only issue I have is the rugdoc thing. I honestly wanted to like the devs  answer  but it wasnt completely adequate IMO. It was okay, but it didnt kill the fear. Thats the only hang up.,Time will tell I am not too worried about it rugging My only concern is that it doesnt get enough traction. There are just not enough projects in this space at the moment and everyone wants to be the next dex. Granted I do shill it when i get into threads where it is but it needs more eyeballs.,Cheggity KCC just getting started. Its already better than binance AND you add in the legit binance issues. Looks like youre not worried about my main concern and Im not worried about your main concern. Were either kinda smart or really fucking dumb.,Like the bell curve meme kekI am tempted to see if I can help the dev out.I want this one to make it for whatever reason,If you know the dev let them know there are anons that want to help we just need tasks.that and the token needs some kind of utility other that being something to stake. Governance whatever, I know these projects take a lot of energy so I get not seeing it day one. The whole thing is impressive regardless.,I’m holding a suicide stack but so far I’m not very optimistic… the community around it is very scammy and immature, even compared to BSC. Every AMM is just a poorly implemented clone of PCS. When PCS cloned Uni, they at least took time to differentiate it from its predecessor and provide value to holders. I see a lot of positivity around Kudex, but IMO they completely fucked up adding adding RFI mechanics to it without whitelisting staking pools, ON TOP of a deposit fee for even their own native pools. This comes off as a naive move by a very inexperienced team.I’ll hold out a little while longer for stables to be added (if it ever happens), but the clock is ticking with so many competing chains offering the same exact experience.,ON TOP of a deposit fee for even their own native poolsYup this is one of my biggest concerns. These fees arent a huge deal if it actually succeeds and maintains good APRs, but its a solid reason some people might choose a competitor instead.Granted so far all the other competitors were scams, so maybe this is the incentive needed on the dev side to keep it from being a rug pull in the first place.,Each point in the RugDoc review was addressed by the devs here: https://docs.kudex.finance/other/fudTheres actually zero risk of a rug, since its literally physically impossible, no matter what the competitors FUD says.You can DM the dev on TelegramTG is absolutely filled with jeets manthey have been flooding Telegram like crazy this bullrunIts making me go crazy,my KCS is hurting...,my KCS is hurting...And this is exactly why nothing on KCC is blowing up yet. No stablecoins or bridge, and KCS is real volatile.Im still hoping that stuff comes soon and launches these projects into orbit. But honestly its pretty likely that most of them fail until the stablecoins launch. And if the rest of the market keeps going down that might not even be enough for this to matter.,how do you block pajeets or randos on tg from messaging you,we need a general for Kudex, but im not a baker. up x200 on staking and farms.,I bought kutools.online, am I retarded? It seemed legit but the presale was confusing so I just waited for the fair launch and it looks like its just premies dumping and theyre not even bothering to promote this on any platform kek,KCS will hold its second quarter 2021 earnings conference call on Friday, July 16, 2021 at 8:45 a.m. eastern time. Shareholders and other interested parties are invited to participate via live webcast or telephone. You can go there Air all your frustration. Yall just leave me to my YLA INVESTMENT. Yall dont understand that despite the market, YLA gained a long one against the market. Making it the Apple of the Markets eye. I will come back here when more updates are added then I will brag about my riches.,x? Yeah I dont believe that, and Im a holder myself. Post wallet.,kek, been farming and putting it back in the pool, allready made 30% in 3 days so i´m not worried,I thought this was a proper Kcc thread but it was a kudex shill lol,we dont need blatant chills, the dev keeps building so it´ll comme organic. maybe some marketing so people know about it but it´s a proper project so we dont need the pajeets,Its not but gl bro, subtle  lmao,Do you have a better project?As far as I can tell it is the main thing that kcs is missing and at the moment this seems to be the most legit.,KCS needs stables and Bridges not a fucking 6% deposit fee niggerswap with tiktok meme competitions,Quality English there, Ranjeet,buying shitcoins during a bear marketwhy though,These things come with adoption for better or worse.You are absolutely right about the stables I want USDC.So far, even if the fees are high, this looks to be the best project.Really though what else have you seen out there that is not a rug or honey pot?Granted this could still be a rug who knows.,Yolod 2k into KCS-KUD pool. Am I fucked?,WERE FUCKING PUMPING also buying $Million in a bear market heheh Im gonna sit this one outBiz literally hates money,k$ or 2k LP tokens?,These fees are killing it though, 5% every trade is breaking my balls man,KoffeeswapDont know what think about that shit https://www.burgermoon.space/,Kill yourselfI want to revive this piece of shit safemoon fork on the Opera network.

Ill do my best to give you a brief overview.Holoride is an Audi spinoff exploring hyper-immersive in-car experiences defined by state-of-the-art XR, combined with navigational and car data, and to be supported by an innovative, transparent blockchain and NFT-powered content ecosystem.Here’s the difference between VR/AR/XR, in case you don’t know (which I certainly didn’t before looking into Holoride): https://www.viget.com/articles/xr-vr-ar-mr-whats-the-difference/While commuting, users are able to enjoy an ever-expanding variety of holorides with their standard XR device.Passengers can choose their experience from a simple interface and the content will immediately adapt to the route, the driving dynamics, and the environment; integrating real events in real-time.”Heres a trailer to more or less picture what that looks like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTSwWV7l8b4Here are the key highlights imo:Highly experienced team, previously had executive/senior positions at Audi.Top Tier Advisory board (amongst the most impressive in the market, in my opinion): https://www.holoride.com/news/advisoryboard/Real/tangible collaborations with world-class companiesPartnered with Universal Pictures and Ford: https://www.holoride.com/news/bride/Collaboration with Porsche and Discovery Channel: https://www.holoride.com/news/edutainment/Full-time development since 2015 (I could only find material from earliest 2019 but I asked them in their telegram group and they said 2015).Working productNFT Content Platform and Marketplace.,Why isnt this being talked about anywhere? Idk seems like a redflag. Something of this scope and size, yet I literally cant see ANYBODY talking about it? What gives,Maybe they just building up suspense, but if you search audi and holoride you can find their info on the audis official website,I can see this blowing up if Uber comes out with an extra class that supports this,Yeah right, ofc they will you retard! Nasa will also give holoride to their astronauts, so when they crash it wont seem that bad,Seems like a very niche market to me... most of the world does not commute in cars, and of those that do Im pretty sure many would get car sick using those goggles,Lol you must be from india or another 3rd world country, you commute by what donkey? flying magic carpet? WHAT it this pajeet motherfuker saying,Fair enough.I mean, theres the good side that because nobody is really talking about it yet, it could signal that its still REALLY early. Ill keep an eye on this one, simply because Im seeing metaverse tokens and the NFT space just blow up. Its nuts. I missed out on AXS, so Im dying to catch the next one.,Motion sickness won’t be an issue since the content will adjust based on your environment: https://www.morningbrew.com/emerging-tech/stories/2019/08/20/holorides-vr-stop-motion-sickness,This seems really cool. For the anon who said most people dont commute by car, why wouldnt this work on a bus or train? We might be really early to this one, fellas.,Its a crazy project thats for sure! ElrondNetwork got themselfs a gem! Its so wierd to see people fuding this project its such a nice concept,Is the crypto called Elrond? I hate this Captcha so fucking much...,Holoride will launch on the Elrond blockchain but they will have their own token most likely,No bro elrond musk is elons little brother and he is investing in holoride! Thats why this will pump! Elrond bullied elon into the person he is today,So its too early to buy into it?,Yeah, the launch is sometime next year,Project release is next year i think,Awesome. Keep makings posts about it. I can see this thing blowing up.,Ok, holy shit, I thought this project was a fucking meme at first. NGL this seems too good to be true. Just saw the videos theyve got on their youtube. WTFI dont really wanna go into a world with this VR shit, but its more than obvious its the future. Might as well invest in the future.Is there any token for this? I cant seem to find much info about there being a token,I feel you 100%, I did a lot of research before I was convinced this is legit. Holoride only launches next year so for now there isnt much info available on the token, but I believe they will have their own token.Everythings going back to pre 2017 prices isnt it...These past 4 years were just a complete and total waste of time werent they...I wish I had never found crypto. It stole 4 years of my life that Im never going to get back and I have absolutely nothing to show for it. In fact its ruined the rest of my life too because I put my career on hold to focus on crypto and now Im a 35 year old neet with no job experience for the last 4 years.

Christ is looking out for you. Dont forget to pray tonight.,Satan gives his hardest mission to his strongest warriors. Lucifer is looking out for you. Don’t forget to sin tonight.,Theres nothing to get through.

Now Im never going to be able to achieve success and Im going to suffer in misery and poverty for the rest of my life until I die.,Am I the only one left here?

Im not even mad, just dont care.,fairly premature hasnt even broken bottom yetget some sleep,Antifragility,What is that supposed to mean? That I should have realized crypto was a waste of time even earlier? I honestly believed in it and thought that it was going to repeat what it did in 2013. Its not until very recently that I realized that these last 2 bull runs were fucking bullshit and that its not going to happen ever again. I just wish I had never found /biz/ because my life would be in such a better place right now if I hadnt had all this false hope these past 4 years. I literally quit my job and did nothing but wait until I had made it. Just completely threw these years of my life away.,Kek,I honestly believed in itLoser. Thesis confirmed.

People who already made have had their made it status unmade,Still here. Sergey is fucking with us, that fat cocksucker. We knew we were playing a dangerous game. What was the alternative wage cuck and hope to catch a pension that won’t be there?,I dont know what point youre trying to make. Sure Im dumb in retrospect but how could I have known it at the time? The only thing I know for sure is that if I hadnt found /biz/ back in April 2017 I would still have a well paying career today, instead of having my low 6 figure life savings in crypto and no prospects for the future.,thesis confirmed ? nigger he hasnt been  through a cycle  yet. And he never will,I learnt my lesson of not selling in 2018 Jan. Ive been taking profits throughout the past year. I have 3x my 2017 investment with 2x cashed out to purchase a property.,kys glowie,For me theres no point in doing any of that, because once I run out of money I will have nothing left and no way to make money ever again. The plan was always to become a millionaire and be able to retire and live off the money. I never had any plan B.,You 1x because you cashed out. Why would you hold fiat or buy property right now?,based,How the fuck can you be in crypto for 4 and not have made it?? Every shit from last year did atleast a 100x in this run,You never believed in crypto. You were just looking for an excuse to justify your behavior. Right now you are reacting because the market is on the edge of a second massive downtrend but you always knew what you were doing was wrong and unjustified. How big is your stack right now? Just use it to start a new life.,Why is this off topic meta shitpost thread unreportableWho paid for it?,No it didnt. I invested $30k in crypto (mostly btc) back in mid 2017 and have waited through 2 entire bull runs for nothing. I guess I made 10x my money at the peak but who cares? Thats at least another 5x away from being able to retire and now its 10x away. At the rate its going, by the end of this month Ill probably be back to where I started. I dont have any job prospects anymore so theres a good chance I wont have any money left by the end of this year and will have killed myself.,I believed in it enough to quit my job and leave my career behind and I continued to believe in it during the entire 2018-2020 bear market, but now I have no hope left anymore. The fact that I keep ending back exactly where I started from after every bull run shows how retarded the whole thing always was. I would have made more money just investing in the stock market 4 years ago.,didnt sell enough again only this time the sums were much bigger. not sure whats wrong with me. legit want to rope now cause of my own stupidity,You invested 30k in 2017 mostly in BTCThen quit your job for cryptoIn 2021 you still have mostly BTC and not made itWhy tf did you quit your job?? What did you do all that time in 2018-2020?,unfathomably based,You quit your job and sit on your ass for 4 years? If you believed in it you would have kept working and bought more during the bear and you would happily have many millions right now even after the collapse. You never believed in anything especially yourself, and you are still making excuses after all these years.,wait 2 years and invest again. take profits as you go. happens every time.,LEARN THE LESSON AND MOVE ON. After you have made a mistake like that it cant get any worse. You can now see plain as day what it takes to make it. You struggle through the bear market to accumulate things that will likely pump during the next run then you TAKE PROFIT during the next bullrun. Accept the delayed gratification and become rich, but right now is the time to wage.,Based. Christ is king.,All markets run in cycles. When you are euphoric its the opposite you feel. That you are on top, in control even godlike. Now is the opposite of spectrum that you are experiencing. Just take time, accept it. Embrace jt and move on. One constant is time. Next cycle begins shortly after capitulation. Just takes time.,These past 4 years were just a complete and total waste of time werent they...told you several months ago lmao,I was sitting and waiting to make it because it seemed like such a sure thing that it would repeat past cycles.I quit my job because I couldn’t stand working anymore and thought I already had enough invested to make it. Even if I hadn’t done that, it’s not like I would have had much more to invest anyway so there’s no way my portfolio would have made it to $1 million.,Its funny and said that you all think this is over. Bitcoin is falling just as inflation is hitting new milestones. When that shit hits $26,000 or so, get ready for it to go Skyward. That shit is going to hit about $85,000. Its going to real back to about $50,000. You want to play it safe? Purchase as much as you can and sell at $80,000.,Incredibly based,yeah it sucks so hard cause I should have literally changed my life this time around, instead Im stuck where ive been for the last 10 yesrs again. dont have much disposable income to accumulate in the next bear either but got no choice but to carry on and learn like you said anon,Cringe,OP before you rope, please buy all the bitcoins you can with fiat and stable.

Even when it was at $60k I was fearful that it was going to all collapse when I still needed it to do at least another 5x. And right now I’m more fearful than I’ve ever been in my entire life. Literally fearing for my life if the market continues to collapse and I run out of my life savings because suicide will be the only option then.,So focus on improving your income. Improve your income, invest it during the bear and become very wealthy. You can do it in a few years but the longer you mope around like this  loser whining about your life the longer you spend your life poor and depressed.,Portfolio value at ATH?,I quit my job because I couldn’t stand working anymorebruh, why didnt you just get a comfy non-job like security guard, you dummy?

My average buy price was around $5k so I have 5 btc. I also lost money on alts over the years. And $500k isn’t nearly enough money when my plan was always to retire from crypto. Getting a job isn’t an option anymore for me.,When the crash happens already  happened  retard ,learn to read common core retard,move to the third world. you will be a millionaire in it with 500k USD. in brazil you will have 2.5 millions in local currency,Stop crying asshole, I have less than 2 BTC. Your whining makes me think the bottom is in.,GME was an obviously retarded investment from the start. Why would I invest in an obsolete store that I can’t stand even shopping at? The reason I invested in crypto was because I thought it was going to be the future of all global finance and commerce. It seemed like getting in on the next big revolution early. That’s what all of /biz/ thought too back in 2017.,Youre an idiot.Good luck with that.,How old are you? Because your age -14 is how many years in a row you have been wrong about  the collapse  lmaolike GMElikebuddy if you cant even basic reading comprehension, why would you ever try to get rich on your own?Also youre proving my point, You think GME is  obviously retarded  but you dont see any problems with a  currency  that has existed for over a decade and not improved at all.

You are completely to blame. Im DCAing into crypto but Im not quitting my college education and developing my industry skills.I didnt make it my life, you went all in on a speculative asset class and didnt take profits. Taking profits at the peak of BTC @ 60K wouldve meant you couldve doubled your stack at 30k. Im just saying, I dont wanna rub salt in the wound, but you cant scapegoat Biz out to being  all their fault,  you have full responsibility over your actions as an adult and if it wasnt crypto it mightve been something else.Take the hard road now and start getting job experience, even if it means tireless nights of job searching and volunteer work, this is the path you need to take. Never put all your eggs in 1 basket ever again and always take profits.

Also swapped some link into GRT and Avax and made big gains there as well, and making passive income. I just wish I could reliably stake link somewhere. Tl;Dr why is everyone mad??,Im here. Though I didnt stake my life on crypto back then, I am now though.Being on /biz/ for 2 cycles with nothing to show for it feels like getting left behind in school and having to repeat a grade, and still failing the second time.,Also thinking about quitting my daytime job and starting my own business.

He was friendly at first and smiled at me. I told him that I wished I could be German just like him, so that I could live in a prosperous, safe, organized, powerful country with stable and strong economy aka in Germany. Too much economic instability, low wages, uncertainty and high corruption index in my homecountry, I added. After hearing my thoughts, he became indifferent towards me and started avoiding looking at me and started only talking in German to flight attendants. Was his behaviour really warranted? What did I say that turned him off just like that? I was being honest. I hate living here. And Germany is the powerhouse of Europe. So yes, I really would like to live there for a change. After this incident I thought that Germans are rude assholes.,Hes offended because youre a spineless cunt who wants to larp as a german.,Do you people fleeing home not realize your dooming your people and neighborhoods to squalor? Keep sending us your best lol. They dont come back. If some cuck came up to me and told me how much better my country is than his I would also be pissed. 1. You dont know what me and my country went through2. So dont compare3. And you putting down your home, means youll likely be putting down your new home soon, this would be unacceptable to a German I imagine,If you all moved to Germany, would it really be Germany anymore?,maybe their cities are full and rampant unchecked immigration is making life increasingly unaffordable to a native population that is confused as to how this obnoxiously high immigration is actually benefiting them (it isnt),No one here is correct. The Germans are arguably the biggest normies/cucks in all of Europe. They are so well conditioned to reject anything that isn’t fully supportive of the socialist dictatorship. It’s scary how well conditioned they are.,im not even some white nationalist or against immigration or anything like that but sometimes it is just way way too much like holy shit. my city in canada is projected to increase population by like 1.6x in like 20 years or something without having any additional land to spread into because of environmental green zones or surrounding farmland. so the plan is to just get rid of the family home and make us pay more to live in smaller places crammed in with other families. and for what. we dont need to bringing in 20 billion immigrants a year. stop. for what? so the liberal party can get votes and so trendies can signal that theyre not racist?,Also true. The Germans i know are more old school who moved away from austria/Germany 50 years ago.,Never seen this pepe before,based budgie pepe,Self-deprecation is never endearing.,modern immigration policies are such a fucking scam to load us all into pods and to ensure an even greater wealth disparity. theyre afraid of competition so the best thing to do is to keep us poor.,I dont owe you shit, dont put your suffering above minet. german,German here.

And this fuck does what he does to me and acts like nothing even happened? Germans are the worst of the worst, I have just realized it too late sadly, they are binary thinking retards who are programmed to see the world in black and white only. Fucking autistic sausage eating niggers.  Spineless cunt  my ass. If someone told me they like my country more than theirs, I would be flattered. Dresdens bombing was clearly not enough. Literal soviet rapebabies and turbo robot retards.

To government, more people means more taxes. They have incentive to fill every wagie position, and even cram in more than needed, regardless of productivity or environmental impact,can confirm, lived in Germany for too many years   while there are individual exceptions, in general the germans are rude unfriendly and aggressive, impatient, and scared of ambiguity. all of the intolerance of the nazi era still exists under the surface. Im getting the fuck out of here as soon as I can, its only the crypto no tax after 1 year hold thats keeping me here,You’re absolutely correct,Exactly, the German being rude and cold doesnt mean anything, he could be the biggest supporter of immigration but he will still treat you ice cold after the first five minutes.This is really not a happy place and never will be.The immigrants are becoming like that too, in different flavours.I think theres a curse on the land itself, probably from hundreds of years ago when we burned witches.,Dumbass, Germans have been conditioned to be anti-nationalistic thanks to ww1 and ww2. They can’t help but feel awkward when foreign people start saying Germany is gut ja?,Where did they go?,youre a fucking weirdo, why do you weirdo try to talk to people in situations like this, I dont want to talk to you,I look whiteSometimes the ‘lip compression’ is accompanied by raising the lower lip which produces a bulge above the upper lip as shown in the image here…This facial expression is unique because it is directed at one’s own self, unlike all other facial expressions which are directed to the person we are communicating with. The person wearing this expression is non-verbally telling himself, “This is wrong” or “I shouldn’t be doing this” or “I’m in trouble.”For instance, if someone greets you with their lips compressed then it means they didn’t mean to greet you and were only doing it out of social obligation. It could even mean they actually dislike you. The fact that their mind did not approve of their action i.e. ‘greeting you’ shows that they were not as happy to meet you as they might have otherwise verbally claimed.,there are many Germans in pennsylvania,I will unironically move to Spain and have babies with some cute Andalusian chicita living on a beach, thanks a lot.Thank god. B-but why do you think there are so many fucking Spanish people in Germany? It’s disgusting. The eastern Europeans, the Italians, the Spanish all come here for whatever reason (I guess it’s just because their economy sucks). We have a lot of fucking muslims and Africans living here already and I can tell you from the bottom of my heart that we want none of that. Why can’t all these people just stay where they are? Do we really need that much cheap labor? That’s my honest question here. Also - the more immigrants we‘re going to receive (I‘m not talking about refugees like the Syrians) the more likely we‘re going to see a right-wing party receiving many more votes in the near future. And this, I can assure you, is going to suck much more for everybody than what we have right now or used to have in the lst couple decades. I‘m asking myself this question every day: how do we avoid the right-wing taking over? I’m pretty convinced not like this!,its LEFT against RIGHTDo Germans really fret over this? Who gives a fuck what label they use. What matters is authoritarian versus libertarian. And you Germans whether it is libshit govvie or conservacucked govvie are under full authoritarian jewed rule.,You are a subhumans and he’s probably sick of living with subhumans who think they have a right to live in his country.

I know you’re angry, and you have every right to be. I’m sorry for providing data feeds to a standard that allow for DeFi applications to run securely on your platform. I’m sorry for increasing your core functionality through a wide range of tools that are developed to world class standards and then given to your ecosystem as open standards for others to build on. I’m sorry for providing technologies that literally hold you to your core promise and ideology of disintermediation and the removal of privileged insiders who extract unfair value, which was your whole USP in the first place. I’m sorry that in doing all of this, all we ever do is talk about supporting ethereum, about building real L2s that are properly tethered to ETH, about adding value and features to ETH, and doing all of this with no drama, no shit talking, no hostility, no hype, just the constant and reliable improvement of the features and functionality of Ethereum.I’m sorry for absolutely and unambiguously vastly improving the utility of your L1, and the experience of every single ethereum user, at the sole expense of a small number of insider profiteers whose views and behaviour are completely antithetical to the basic premise of crypto, and who have become the very insider finance bros they originally promised to supplant.Sorry for saving your platform from itself.Love,Chainlink,And what exactly am I defending?The fud.They (as in fags like NEXO) manipulate the price first, then spam the board to make it seem that the FUD has use.

And yeah probably an autist too T. another finn,ya bruv im clearly using the word drumpf at face value in the liberal demeaning sense in a post where i implicitely tie myself to his supportersthis is why you fags are hated. your midwit dunning-kruger sperging out all over this board has ruined discussions more than pajeet shillsimagine thinking youre  redpilled  for investing into two jews,no one cares stupid faggot,The  token not needed  spam? Do you actually think this causes people to sell or developers looking to integrate with LINK to lose faith in the project?Literally yes.See pic; just two examples off the top of my head from two well-known crypto devs propagating the  token not needed  fud.Wipe the shit from your eyes and look around you.,We dont need flags to know you are Bulgarian,no u are teh fudderWhat is with these retarded misdirection attempts?Babbys first pilpul?,Yeah Edgar was definitely influenced by TNN spam on /biz/, it had nothing to do with the fact he has been making millions from MEV and he just saw his cash cow is going to die.,So youre saying the MEV maffia cant possibly be behind some of the fud on here?,I feel like they came through in a wave after it hit the news, there was a conspicuous group of hysterical retards trying to defend MEV in retarded terms, which I ascribed to them. I dont see them as sources of the organised and ongoing fud though.,The token not needed fud is everywhere, not just on /biz/.Its all part of the general massive fud campaign against Chainlink.,To be specific; I did not claim the TNN fud on /biz/ convinced Edgar.I said the TNN fud in general (including the TNN fud by Edgar) is indeed convincing large masses of people that the token is not needed.,assuming the smart solution wins out just because it is technically bettercryptothe devs in this space are technically smart but holy fuck are they complete droolers in every other facet of businessfuck you people are so stupid,BetamaxVHS,the devs in this space are technically smart but holy fuck are they complete droolers in every other facet of businesseven technically, they still didnt get LINK, and some still dont, but we do, go figure pretty serious case of smelling too many of their own farts,Is chainlink even used by anything though? Not something  in the future , but right now.,Jesus fucking christ anon.,It provides LP? Or wtf is this.,Fuck off.,The moment I was waiting for was mainnet release 2019. This is just icing,Do you niggers not remember how everyone like you was saying the exact same fucking thing about SWIFT, despite Chainlink having a statement up on their website (smartcontract.com) for YEARS on end that they were working with SWIFT, which was all re-confirmed just last month?,Sergey personally puts up the liquidity from his own pockets for all of defi. Billions of dollars of TVL is entirely from Sergeys pockets due to dumping the LINK token. Without Sergeys liquidity this bull run would have never happened.,Every single one of Chainlinks users pays Chainlink.,No, you hope LINK goes to $0 because you missed out on the greatest investment this board had to offer since ETH and now you are jealous of a bunch of people who became millionaires off a few thousand dollars.,the people browsing /biz/ are so new they think Arb + Link is newsthey probably dont know Ed is part of the Chainlink teamthey probably dont even know who Ed isIm so fucking tired of you retards.,who is ed?,OMG GUISE ED FUCKING FELTEN IS WORKING WITH LINK OMG OMG OMGAnd fucking Rosie Rios just joined ripple board of directors, it means SHIT.,Arbitrum is just a testnet, it is not meant to be released to the public and will not be used for real-life transactions,greatest investment this board had to offerThat would be DOGE, SHIB, HOGE, etc. or even fucking Million Coin.

You can buy mine at $1k if you want to wait.,You shouldve seen at what point chainlink went on its rip from under a dollar all the way to +15$ (hint: it was all when btc and eth was bearish as fuck),Lots of slide threads appearing in the catalog right nowFeeling pretty bullish for the first time in a while,not even 3 days of positive movement and youre  bullish.  This really is the end huh,sold the bottom smugnessI think only up from here fren.,,I see you dont have any linkEPNS announce that are working with TrueFi to develop the core EPNS protocol.uys, whos keeping an eye with EPNS project? seems trending??,Im following EPNS for almost 4 months now. As what I have observe the project is realy doing great, imagine they release a lot of new features this month including EPNS browser extension and Liquidation risks Notifications.,Im currently busy staking LPs and trading. Taking profits and accumulate more push for future.,Not only that they also release their showrunner framework backend sdk v1.0,Oh! I missed that news!! Epns is very promising and potential tools. As I can see it now.Every time you suggest theres going to be a market crash, someone comes up with this genius piece of knowledgeheheh you faggots were saying this when it was 1kthen 2kthen 3kAre they just low IQ or what? The simple fact its gone up so fast so quickly should be an indication that a crash/major correction is incoming.,we have had 10 red weeks in a row. Im not saying were about to enter a new bull market but every week that passes makes it increasingly more likely that we are going to have a green week,green weeks in a bear marketWhos going to tell him?,This is mainly to do with the stock market. But actually, people were saying the exact same things before the crypto market crash.,the most red weeks we have had in a row in the entire history of bitcoin is 14 in a row you fucking retard. go read some charts before you @ me literal retard,enjoy your 4 more weeks of suffering until the deadcat bounce from 21k to 26.6k lmao,i dunno, youre applying the rules of different asset classes to crypto. im not sure anyone actually knows what stable growth in crypto is supposed to look like, maybe bitcoin has it i dont know. crypto is a very new and different thing coming at us quickly and capable of so much but at the same time no other asset class has been this easy and trustless to buy and sell by its very nature. were essentially replacing the background infrastructure of digital civilization and still discovering the price on that.,I just screencapped your shitty postSee you in a couple of weeks nigger,its nobodys fault but your own that you didnt buy into bitcoin under 1k, though.,bear marketWhos going to tell him?,all what bears do is hope the price goes down enough to be able to get remotely respectable stacks at the end through both shorting and swingingI literally dont have to anything but wait. enjoy staring at 1 minute charts all day every dayWhat you can say about bullperks guys?I see bullperks is heading,What you mean multichain launchpad? Possible to launch like BSC, CARADONO, Solana? and more,Yes, startups can now launch IDO on bullperks,I think this is nice, do we need to hold certain amount of tokens to join the IDO?,yes, but not expensive as Ignition , duckstarter and polkastarter. By joining bullperks we only need 500 BLP to be able to join, and 500 blp is which around $40 only, not bad,Wow thats affordable. Can I have their website please,app.bullperks.com,ser , this is fully organic chat between to peepee. no idea to stress.mister thank youI used to be big on XMR a few years ago but I soon came to realize the network security cant justify its on chain privacy, Id rather have the most secure network with opt-in privacy than a weakly secured network with strong enforced privacy.Just looking at BTC vs XMR the following is what I can see:BTC has a stronger network than XMRBTC has opt-in privacy like coinjoins which are just as good if used properlyBTC post taproot coinswaps are penultimate privacy for networks where privacy isnt defaultBTC doesnt force privacy on the users, rather the privacy aware users can opt-in (as mentioend before many privacy tools are developed/being developedNow Im not saying XMR is bad, it has its own place in the ecosystem but the shilling lately is getting a little ridiculous, are people just learning about ringct or are just using it for *actual* shady stuff?,Can you elaborate on how the network security of XMR is less than of BTCs?,Simply in terms of hashing power, it simply does not compare to BTCs is what I meant, BTC is the most secure network in the existence of mankind, and thats worth something in my eyes,wow thats retarded as fuck bro, you know btc is mined with asics right?,how can someone look at the past years hasharte charts and come to the conclusion that literally any chain other than monero is  secure and decentralized . Monero is the only coin that didnt loose like half its  security  due to china ban.,To be fair, monero is perhaps the only crypto along with bitcoin that is used for transactions right now. Everything else is a shitcoin pump and dump, or unreleased projects like ETH, ADA, etc.,Obviously? I dont get the question here, are you telling me the security of the network is stronger than bitcoins by a significant amount? You do realize theres nothing thats had more scrutiny than bitcoin itself. Again just an example and not saying XMR is bad in itself but it doesnt justify the shilling going around here.What are you talking about? You dont even need to look at any figures or charts, youre literally talking about economic incentives here - bitcoin is magnitudes more competitive, you cannot claim to me xmr is anywhere near it.Personally I havent seen many places using XMR or accepting it so I could be mistaken.,I have seen an up tick in dealers opting to use XMR online.,People like me realizing its by far the superior coin? Ignore fundamentals at your own peril. Optional privacy doesnt work. Money requires real fungibility.,If by security you mean centralized ASIC mining farms then I guess youre right it is the most secured blockchain. I just think XMRs RandomX with its ASIC resistant algorithms are more secure in the long run if it sees more adoption and is put more money into.,When will the rest realize that XMR is a fundamentally sound and good coin and make a moon mission out of it? Im so tired of normies following the narrative of hype and vaporware marketing of these shitcoins, instead of pumping the actual coins with value,BTC has opt-in privacy like coinjoins which are just as good if used properlyif used properlyYeah, and trading can yield 10k% per day if done properly.Imagine that you are a criminal, or just a person who cares about privacy, and you are choosing between XMR and BTC. How would you reason your choice?Low IQ: duh, dum-dum crooks were caught using BTC, no crooks were caught using XMR; XMR is The Thing.High IQ: opt-in privacy leaves enough room for human error, increasing the risks without providing any benefits for my allegedly illicit transactions; thus, XMR is simply a better tool that I should prefer over BTC.But yeah, midwits look at hashing power (ignoring that half of it can disappear overnight) and say ACKSHUALLY BTC BETTER.XMR is the only coin that I fully believe in. Tech, adoption and developer ethos — nothing comes close. BTC is just a popular shitcoin.,Anyway my point is basically the following:What happens when the biggest cryptocurrency network has privacy features that is on par or even better than XMR? That is the question I pretty much gambled on a few years ago and I can say that I havent changed my perspective till this day, its far more likely that on chain privacy is growing in btc, and some may argue its already here thats just as good as XMRs, so from XMRs perspective I dont see what there is to grow towards besides the network size which obviously cannot outgrow other networks.I did use to own XMR but realized its shortcomings when I seriously thought of the fundamental roadblocks that lay ahead preventing it from  mooning Optional privacy does work, I dont see whats more libertarian than giving the people to choose whether they want privacy or not, not only that people parrot that BTC has no privacy features and its just wrong. I am guessing you dont think BTC is fungible as I once used to think, reach Chris Belchers  teleport transaction  implementation of CoinSwap, hes proposed a BIP, and if you want something NOW look at chaumian coinjoin developed by SamouraiWallet (Whirlpool is their implementation name).I know youre being fallacious with the centralized asics, but regardless of how you look at it, 3GH/s on XMRs network and 100EH/s on BTC does not even compare, even if you somehow find a way to equate sha256/randomX it is orders of magnitudes different, so that is what I mean by its less secure.,im 100% nigger,Youre right in that hash rate shouldnt be the only factor people consider, afterall different algos. Though its just childish to say that a 100EH/s network is going to be comparable to 3GH/s even considering the different algos.What exactly is it about XMR that you believe in mostly, ringCTs? Its pretty similar to BTCs, youre making it sound as if theres no active fight and development towards improving liberty and freedom via privacy. This is coming from a pro XMR person himself, and again im not anti XMR or anything, it has its use for now but I do see that being challenged in the future.,BTC has a stronger network than XMRYou cant directly compare ASIC farms for SHA256 with CPU restricted mining algos, theyre incompatible with each otherBTC has opt-in privacy like coinjoins which are just as good if used properlyIf coinjoin worked as intended privacy coins would be irrelevant BTC post taproot coinswaps are penultimate privacy for networks where privacy isnt defaultSecond layer  solutions  for BTC are a centralized meme, Vitalik pointed this out in his last interview. Which is made even worse by the fact BTC will never increase the laughable blocksize, implement sharding, etc..BTC doesnt force privacy on the users, rather the privacy aware users can opt-in (as mentioend before many privacy tools are developed/being developedTheres real no privacy, nor there will ever be for BTC,What exactly is it about XMR that you believe in mostlyringCT is just an icing on the privacy cake, the foundation lies somewhere else:pretty similar to BTCs, youre making it sound as if theres no active fight and development towards improving liberty and freedom via privacyThats the core problem: BTC devs have different ethos. If there is a  fight  for privacy, I cant trust them to deliver privacy; just like I will never trust zCash devs who want their shitcoin to be  private , but backdoored agains  bad guys .XMR doesnt have this issue — it is a privacy coin, period.,Its simply THAT good.,Could you elaborate on why you cant trust  them  to deliver privacy, who exactly is them? And everything in the ecosystem is transparent and auditable, if somethings private by design - you can prove and verify that, thats the point of the ecosystem were in.I never argued XMR wasnt a privacy coin.You cant directly compare ASIC farms for SHA256 with CPU restricted mining algos, theyre incompatible with each otherYes though a cheat answer, regardless of how much you want to estimate by comparing the algos 3GHs vs 100EHs is not comparable.If coinjoin worked as intended privacy coins would be irrelevant What? Are you implying that it doesnt work as intended? I feel like a lot of XMRers are actively ignoring that things like this already exist and work well and are pretending they dont workSecond layer  solutions  for BTC are a centralized meme, Vitalik pointed this out in his last interview. Which is made even worse by the fact BTC will never increase the laughable blocksize, implement sharding, etc..Wasnt really talking about second layer solutions, rather the flexibility taproot enables for many things of which privacy tools is one of them.Theres real no privacy, nor there will ever be for BTCJust a flat out lie that I see propagated a lot, is it really that hard to believe BTC has private transactions? Again I see XMR has its use in the ecosystem but saying BTC is not private is being willfully ignorant,top part meant for ,Just a flat out lie that I see propagated a lot, is it really that hard to believe BTC has private transactions? Again I see XMR has its use in the ecosystem but saying BTC is not private is being willfully ignorantBitcoins privacy will no doubt get better but it will NEVER be able to do what Monero does, honest maxipads like Andreas can admit this.Why Monero is so untraceable:- nobody inspecting the blockchain can deterministically prove who signed the transaction. (Ring Signatures)- nobody inspecting the blockchain can determine the amount of XMR being transacted. (Confidential Transactions)- nobody inspecting the blockchain can determine where the XMR was sent to. (Stealth Addresses)- Dandelion++/I2P/Tor provide network-level shielding of IP addresses.TL;DR: Monero addresses   amounts do not appear on the blockchain and thus cannot be derived through chain analysis.To quote Andreas:  Bitcoin is not a privacy coin. ,My problem with bitcoin is that everyone on this market think btc can solve all problems of mankind, when in fact because of the narrative of price go up, bitcoin is conforming itself to the stablishment, for example going green, censoring transactions. Also, because most people wont use its privacy, bitcoin will in fact allow the state apparatus to get bigger in bigger. Hell, if you are a libertarian, you can easily see how bitcoin is even worse than cash (in privacy terms), so the state could actually use the tranparency of the coin to dominate you. Money needs to be fungible and anonymous by default, thats how society progress.,When you have concrete examples like that I agree, its far superior than what exists in its BTC counterparts.Payjoin is pretty interesting, you essentially cannot determine the amount being sent on chain as with a collaborator to the person youre sending to the receiver essentially commits an input to the same transaction. So yes youre right but I do think XMRers overlook as to how close the technology is coming, I dont think its just a shut book and its never going to happen end of story, but rather an evolving landscape that will reach comparable privacy one day, but thats my optimismSome good points, and I agree. I think a lot of people would change their mind if they really saw what exists already in terms of privacy features.,the only problem bitcoin solves is dollar inflation. end of the story,it sucks in every other sense. Monero give your privacy and thats about it. anything else is almost useless,Desperation from bagholders who realize theyve been holding a stablecoin that couldnt even pass its previous ATH from 4 years ago., who exactly is them?People listed here — https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors — and organisations involved in/guiding/funding the development process. Could you elaborate on why you cant trust  them  to deliver privacyBecause there is a clear clash of interests. Some actors want all transactions to remain transparent for one reason or another (e.g. CEXes want to avoid pressure from banks and governments, government agencies want to peek into everyones pocket etc), and they are likely to hinder/sabotage/undo privacy improvements. And everything in the ecosystem is transparent and auditableYes, but if you look at the growing number of commits youll realise: even if you are willing to audit the code and review the algorithms — you cant keep up with changes, you have to trust the devs in the most literal sense.Auditability in theory does not mean youll notice that things arent really as good as you are hoping for. Especially when there is a growing number of features that people want to add. I never argued XMR wasnt a privacy coin.It is not about you accepting that XMR is a privacy coin, it is about those who work on it seeing it as a privacy coin first and foremost. I can imagine btc devs one day deciding  nah, privacy features make LN too slow, lets disable some of them  — but thats unthinkable for XMR devs.,exactly,You raise good points, its certainly like the fundamental issue with auditing the linux kernel - simply not practical. Though I will contest you on the idea that the bitcoin devs need to implement privacy. This is a misunderstanding it simply is not needed for them to ever develop privacy options if they have a conflict of interest - just look at coinjoins, Samourai has developed their own coinjoin which is auditable (on a practical level) and is used by many and growing in user base, similar could be said about wasabi (though I think their implementation is garbage as you can see by them releasing v2 which is embarrassing).The same will go for coinswap which will pretty much transactions disappear on chain. I highly encourage you to take a look, just humor me. https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/ca5051285c6f8d38693fd127575be44dAgain its not needed or up to the  devs  to make these changes as its not on the protocol level at the moment., it has its own place in the ecosystemAs the only currency thats used as internet cash. A coinjoin isnt going to stop a glownigger,A coinjoin isnt going to stop a glowniggerDepends on the amount, if youre spending a few btc then its virtually untraceable due to the anonymity set. If youre trying to hide 10,000 btc you hacked from somewhere, then yeah Id probably consider swapping to XMR and even then slowly converting back to BTC over a period of years,when we moon?,Because people on this board get their ideologies involved instead of worrying about money, which by the way, BTC is still more profitable to hold.,monero is so absolutely balls to the wall dedicated to being the currency we wanted bitcoin to be. fuck i sound like a shill. when your coin has values not just value people shill it for free lets just say that. the value here being the concept of  fuck you none of your business ,Id rather have the most secure networkThat would be XMREven if you removed every single pool and personal miner, the network would remain unattackable due to multiple layers of mining botnets. You cannot make a network that competes with XMR in security. There is no discipline in which BTC offers an advantage over XMR, with the exceptions of market cap and liquidity. And those arent exactly set in stone.,i dont even have any monero i just shill it for free,You do realize theres nothing thats had more scrutiny than bitcoin itselfYes there is, theres MoneroWere now almost five years into the collective denial of the crypto (((industry))) that Monero, not Bitcoin or Ethereum, is the example to follow,guys fair warning, dont bring your hardware wallet with you when you go fishing on the boat, you wouldnt want to accidentally drop it in the water and lose all your monero. stay safe,Based monerochad, ygmi,Why would you use cumbersome and expensive half-measures like coin mixers when a vastly superior option like XMR exists? Are you not aware coin mixers like coinjoin or Tornado charge several hundred times the fees youd be paying just swapping your alt into XMR and back? Or are we all supposed to hold eight figures and disregard a $50 price tag on a transaction that could have been done for $0.5?,Crazy thread. Kinda derps my brain. Op out here talking about shit he has no idea about, and using words that he doesnt seem to know what they mean. Is this a troll? I have no idea what is going on.,Im a monero chad, but I liked OPs discussion. It seems a sincere questioning to me. I agree with anon herethe value here being the concept of  fuck you none of your business ,I want to see monero take off and rise in network strength as OCs and rich politicians and businessmen all around the world start to use monero and contribute to the blockchain by mining and runing nodes. I genuinely think its simply a matter of time though.,Before FIAT money implodes, when everyone finally realizes crypto is here to stay, I bet most top officials will do whatever it takes to buy monero and vanish with the purchasing power of the retards that keep holding fiduciary moneyLookBasically im.....Im just not going to sellI know.......God i know......Im sorry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Its just that Im not going to sell is all.HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,Pure manipulation at this point.
